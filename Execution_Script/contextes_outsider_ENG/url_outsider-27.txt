Find More Ways to Be an Outsider

   The world is full of outsiders: students away at a university far from
   home, immigrants to a new country, and people who go abroad for work or
   extended travel. Over the past year, more than 4.4 million American
   workers quit their jobs in the “Great Resignation,” and many of them
   became outsiders by joining a different company or moving to a new
   place, which they perhaps imagined might be friendlier to their
   personal needs and tastes.

   But just because a journey to the unfamiliar was voluntary doesn’t make
   it easy: Being an outsider can be lonely and difficult, especially if
   all the strangers around you seem to know and understand one another.
   Your instincts might tell you that uprooting yourself was a terrible

   The truth is, however, you almost certainly did not make a mistake.
   There is little evidence that being an outsider creates long-term
   problems for happiness or lowers your chance of success; on the
   contrary, people thrust between places and cultures tend to develop
   strength, flexibility, and resiliency. Being an outsider may be one of
   the best investments you will ever make, and you should embrace it,
   pain and all.

   Scholars have studied outsiders, including immigrants, refugees,
   students, and foreign workers, to understand the long-term effects on
   well-being and personal success. Some of the most illuminating work has

   A lot of older theories of philosophy and psychiatry would predict
   tough outcomes for outsiders, especially TCKs—and indeed, would
   recommend against being one if you can avoid it. In Laws, Plato argued
   that people should not even travel abroad before age 40, and that

   Outsiders do tend to face particular genres of hardships, especially
   distrust by insiders. Despite the biblical injunction “Do not oppress a
   foreigner,” even believers often disregard friendliness in favor of

   However, with all due respect to Plato, outsiders can actually do very
   well. True, they generally suffer somewhat in the short term after a
   move. For example, one recent study showed that international college
   students rated their life satisfaction about 4 percent lower at the end
   of their first semester than at the beginning of the term. But a
   mountain of evidence shows that in the long run, being an outsider
   predicts well-being and emotional strength; it may even protect against
   depression.

   Spending time as an outsider is like any other big, taxing investment
   you can make in yourself: difficult and maybe painful, but with a
   positive, lifelong payoff. You might think of it as less like a fun
   vacation, and more akin to a voluntary personal challenge, like
   training for a triathlon. Here are a few ideas to incorporate an
   outsider ethos into your life.

1. Remember that being an outsider is a feature, not a bug.

2. Find regular ways to be an outsider.

   Given the benefits of bicultural experiences, don’t leave your outsider
   status up to circumstance. Find opportunities to be on the margins,
   looking in. In my profession of academia, for instance, we regularly

   regular haunts—go to a new church, club, or gym where you know no one.

3. Make friends with outsiders, even if you aren’t one.

   Remember that the third culture of TCKs is the one they form together
   as outsiders. Although no studies that I could find have looked at the
   therapeutic benefits of this third culture per se, it stands to reason
   that such bonding is crucial to the outsider’s superior adjustment
   capacity; it is a way to practice creating one’s own culture
   spontaneously. Even if you aren’t an outsider, you can learn these
   skills by joining those in your community who are. Look for the new
   people in your workplace or town, who are probably hanging out

   In candor, I’m approaching this topic with a fair amount of bias. Being
   an outsider early in my adulthood was the most positive experience I
   have ever had. At 25, I moved to a foreign country where I didn’t speak
   a word of the language, and knew not one soul save for a woman I hoped
