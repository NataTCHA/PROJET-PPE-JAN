Video shows uniformed policeman threatening migrant with penknife, court told

   Thursday, 13 October 2022, 12:01 Last update: about 4 months ago

   A video of  police officer Luca Brincat gesturing in a threatening
   manner using a penknife while seated in front of "a black person" was
   posted in a Whatsapp group, a Court was told on Thursday.

   "In the video, Brincat is heard telling the man that he should stop
   causing trouble, 'or else!'. Brincat then proceeded to gesture as if he
   would slit his throat," inspector Omar Zammit testified.

   The compilation of evidence against three young police officers accused
   of abducting and beating foreigners started yesterday in front of
   Magistrate Joe Mifsud.

   Rica Mifsud Grech, 22, from Floriana, and Jurgen Falzon, 24, from Santa
   Venera, and Luca Brincat, 20, from Qormi, were arrested last weekend
   after being reported by fellow police officers.

   Zammit testified that on the night between 1 and 2 September, Jurgen
   Falzon and Luca Brincat had noticed a foreigner shouting because he was
   drunk in Marsa. The two officers, who were accompanied by a third
   colleague, called Lydon, placed the man against a car to search him.

   Lydon told police that Luca Brincat and Jurgen Falzon proceeded to beat
   up the man. He also claimed that Jurgen Falzon even threw a rock at the
   man's direction. Lydon had told police that his two colleagues had
   exhibited similar aggression with other foreigners.

   The court heard how Lydon had pointed out a video that was posted in a
   chat group with the accused, and other police officers from the
   community policing team. "The black man was filmed from behind."

   Laying down the timeline of events, Zammit said that on Friday 7
   October, the police force received a report from a female police
   constable about crimes allegedly committed by her colleagues at the
   Ħamrun police station. They allegedly beat foreigners. She said that
   she had confided with two other colleagues about the alleged crimes.

   Zammit said that when analysing footage from the body cams of the
   accused, a recording on Luca Brincat's bodycam showed a foreign
   national alleging he was beaten up by Brincat and Falzon. This appears
   to have been a separate incident.

   The court was told that neither of the three victims' injuries were
   certified, because they had not sought medical help.

   Superintendent Graziella Muscat, who is stationed at the Professional
   Standards Unit within the police corps. She said that on 4 October, an
   email was received by the unit from two sergeants.

   "That is where the issue all started," she told the court. "These two
   sergeants wanted to speak to us about their subordinates. We put it on
   our work agenda, and it was scheduled for the 10 October, because we
   didn't know what it was about."

   "I received a call about two days later from one of the sergeants, who
   said the issue could not wait because the constables were beating up
   black people and leaving them there," Muscat said.

   She said her unit was also aware of Brincat's video. Muscat explained
   that the video shows the police officer asking the victim his name and
   then pretending to write the name using the pocket knife.

   "We also knew about two other victims, apart from the one shown in the
   video. We then started looking for them. On one of them, all we knew
   was that he last resided at a Valletta residence but was not there. The
   police then proceeded to go to the Tiger Bar area, to ask the community
   there, but to no avail," she said.

   Inspectors Joseph Mercieca and Omar Zammit prosecuted. Lawyers Anthony
   Vella and Kaylie Bonnett represented the Office of the Attorney
   General.

   Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb are defence counsel for Luca
   Brincat, Dalli and Dean Hili for Rica Mifsud Grech and Edmond Cuschieri
   for Falzon.

   12:28 That is all for today. Thank you for following. A summary of
   proceedings will be published shortly.

   12:28 Caruana steps off the witness stand. The sitting is over. The
   next appointments are for the 18 and 20 October.

   12:22 Police Major Eugenio Caruana takes the witness stand. He recounts
   the testimony given by the police officers who reported the accused.
   This is a re-run of the testimony given by other investigators
   previously

   12:17 He steps off the witness stand.

   12:17 Inspector Jeffrey Rizzo takes the witness stand. He details
   Jurgen Falzon’s arrest, how his mobile was confiscated and handed over
   to a court expert.

   12:15 Muscat steps off the witness stand.

   12:15 Defence lawyer Veronique Dalli asks Muscat whether her unit
   received any report from Rica Mifsud Grech, against her sergeant. Dalli
   says her client had reported on unethical behaviour by her supervisor,
   including “sexist actions”. Muscat insists she has no knowledge of the
   report.

   12:10 Defence lawyer Edmond Cuschieri asks Muscat whether she knew that
   her unit had received any reports on the accused’s sergeants. “Not to
   my knowledge, no,” she replies.

   12:09 Superintendent Graziella Muscat continues testifying. She gives
   details on where and when the three accused were arrested. The
   accused’s cars and homes were searched. A taser torch not issued by the
   corps was found at Rica Mifsud Grech’s home.

   12:07 QUICK RECAP: We are assisting for the first sitting in the
   compilation of evidence against three suspended police officers accused
   of rounding up foreigners, beating them and abandoning them in a
   secluded area. The three officers are: Rica Mifsud Grech, Luca Brincat
   and Jurgen Falzon. They deny the charges. The accused were reported by
   their colleagues in the force.

   12:03 Muscat: “We also knew about two other victims, apart from the one
   shown in the video. We then started looking for them. On one of them,
   all we knew was that he last resided at a Valletta residence but was
   not there. The police then proceeded to go to the Tiger Bar area, to
   ask the community there, but to no avail.”

   12:00 She says her unit was also aware of the video in which the pocket
   knife is visible. She explains that the video shows the police officer
   asking the victim his name and then pretending to write the name using
   the pocket knife.

   11:58 Muscat: “I received a call about two days later from one of the
   sergeants, who said the issue could not wait because the constables
   were beating up black people and leaving them there.”

   11:57 Muscat says that on 4 October, an email was received by the unit
   from two sergeants. “That is where the issue all started,” she tells
   the court. “These two sergeants wanted to speak to us about their
   subordinates. We put it on our work agenda, and it was scheduled for
   the 10 October, because we didn’t know about what it was.”

   11:56 Muscat is stationed at the Professional Standards Unit within the
   police corps.

   11:56 The second witness for today is Superintendent Graziella Muscat.

   11:55 Defence lawyer Edmond Cuschieri, appearing for Jurgen Falzon,
   asks whether the injuries mentioned by the victim were certified.
   Zammit replies: “No because they did not go to the authorities.”

   11:53 Zammit says that the victim indicated that a third officer was
   present, and although he did not beat him up the officer stood aside
   and did not try to stop his colleagues.

   11:53 Under cross-examination, Zammit says that one of the victims told
   investigators that he was picked up by the accused while drunk. He was
   taken to a place not very far from Marsa and was beaten up over there.
   The victim told police he was punched and kicked by the accused.

   11:52 Constables are also issued with body cams and pepper spray.

   11:51 Zammit says that constables have handcuffs and tasers.

   11:49 Zammit is cross-examined by Brincat’s defence lawyer, Franco
   Debono. The lawyer asks the inspector to say what equipment police
   constables are issued with by the force.

   11:48 Zammit says that after the officers were arrested, police started
   looking for their victims and one was traced to prison

   11:47 Zammit says that Brincat was interrogated in the presence of his
   lawyers when discharged from hospital. Brincat refused to answer.

   11:45 Inspector Zammit testifies that when analysing footage from the
   body cams of the accused, a recording on Luca Brincat’s bodycam shows a
   foreign national alleging he was beaten up by Brincat and Falzon. This
   appears to be a separate incident.

   11:43 The police officer who reported the three had showed the
   inspector where they would beat up the foreign nationals.

   11:43 On the 8 October, Luca Brincat was admitted to the Floriana
   polyclinic because he complained about chest pains and that is why he
   couldn’t be charged with the other two police officers.

   11:43 Laying down the time line of events, Zammit says that on Friday 7
   October, the police force received a report from a female police
   constable about crimes allegedly committed by her colleagues at the
   Ħamrun police station. They allegedly beat foreigners. She said that
   she had confided with two other colleagues about the alleged crimes.

   11:40 Inspector Omar Zammit continues testifying that Jurgen Falzon was
   arrested at his Santa Venera home. A search in his vehicle and his
   bedroom revealed nothing.

   11:39 A taser torch and pepper spray not issued by the corps, which
   were found in Rica Mifsud Grech’s car, and the pocket knife visible in
   the video are exhibited in court.

   11:38 The black man was filmed from behind.

   11:38 The court hears how Lydon had pointed out a video that was posted
   in a chat group with the accused, and other police officers from the
   community policing team. The video shows Luca Brincat with a penknife,
   standing in front of a black person. In the video, Brincat is heard
   telling the man that he should stop causing trouble, “or else!”.
   Brincat then proceeded to gesture as if he would slit his throat.

   11:35 Lydon told police that Luca Brincat and Jurgen Falzon proceeded
   to beat up the man. He also claimed that Jurgen Falzon even threw a
   rock at the man’s direction. Lydon had told police that his two
   colleagues had exhibited similar aggression with other foreigners.

   11:34 The court hears how Luca Brincat told Lydon to drive to Qormi.
   Lydon asked why they were going there instead of the police depot.
   Lydon claimed he was told by Luca Brincat to turn off the bodycam, and
   when he refused they turned it off for him.

   11:33 Zammit testifies that on the night between 1 and 2 September,
   Jurgen Falzon and Luca Brincat had noticed a foreigner shouting because
   he was drunk in Marsa. The two officers, who were accompanied by a
   third colleague, called Lydon, placed the man against a car to search
   him.

   11:31 Inspector Omar Zammit will be testifying. He says a female
   constable had gone to police HQ, to report her colleague over some
   crimes. The crimes included beating up individuals. Zammit says that
   together with a CMRU inspector, he was charged with carrying out the
   investigation.
