The Texan 'outsider' turning Parisian fashion on its head

Daniel Roseberry is reigniting Elsa Schiaparelli's formidable legacy and
--
   her time.

   She was an outsider, something that Roseberry can relate to coming to
   Paris as a little-known designer from Texas, who had spent 11 years
   working in New York at Thom Browne, a designer who himself likes to
   play with surrealist concepts. “I can see that there is a freedom to
   being an outsider that gives you permission to play by the rules or
   not,” Roseberry says. “I think there is something about this outsider’s
   perspective, where mastering something that you were not raised with
   gives you a different perspective.”
