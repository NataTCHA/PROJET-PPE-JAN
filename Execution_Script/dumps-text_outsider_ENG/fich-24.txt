   One of the most wide-ranging studies of prejudice undertaken in a
   decade, The Outsider combines new research methods and rich analysis to
   upend many of our assumptions about prejudice. Noting that hostility
   toward immigrants has been on the rise throughout Western Europe, Paul
   Sniderman and his team conduct the first study of prejudice in Italy
   and offer insights applicable to nearly all countries worldwide. The
   study of prejudice, they argue, has been both stimulated and limited by
   tensions among partial theories. Prejudice and group conflict are said
   to be rooted in the psychological makeup of individuals, or
   alternatively, to spring from real competition over material goods or
   social status, or yet again, to follow in the wake of a quest for
   identity. It is the distinctive effort of The Outsider to develop a
   unified theory of prejudice integrating personality, realistic
   conflict, and social identity approaches.
   Drawing on computer-assisted interviewing, this book focuses on Italy
   partly because it has experienced two different waves of immigration,
   from Northern Africa and Eastern Europe, and thus allows one to
   consider to what extent the color of immigrants’ skin imposes a special
   burden of prejudice. Italy is also an apt site for the study of
   intolerance because of long-standing prejudices that have existed
   internally, between Northern and Southern Italians. The book’s findings
   show that any point of difference — color, nationality, or language —
   marks the immigrant as an outsider. The fact of difference, not the
   particular mode of difference, is crucial. Moreover, the general
   election of 1994 provided a rare opportunity to investigate the
   political impact of prejudice when the party system was itself in the
   process of transformation. The authors uncover a potential line of
   cleavage: rather than prejudice being concentrated on the political
   right, it has a wide following among the less educated of the political
   left.
   Analyzing the contributions of personality, social-structural factors,
   and political orientation to the wave of intolerance toward immigrants,
   The Outsider offers unprecedented insights into the phenomenon of
   prejudice and its link to politics.
   Paul M. Sniderman is Professor of Political Science at Stanford
   University. A Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he
   is the author of the widely influential The Scar of Race, coauthored

   Pierangelo Peri is Titular Lecturer of Methodology and Technics of
   Social Research at the University of Trento. Rui J. P. de Figueiredo,
   Jr., is Assistant Professor of Business and Public Policy at the Haas
   School of Business and is Assistant Professor in the Department of
   Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Thomas
   Piazza is Senior Survey Statistician at the Survey Research Center at
   the University of California, Berkeley.

   "A timely, provocative analysis of the sources of political prejudice
   in contemporary Italy."—Choice

   "The timing of Sniderman and his colleagues is impeccable: Just as
   right-wing extremism, driven by xenophobia, reaches the top of the
   European agenda (and not only in Austria), they bring to fruition this
   important six-year study of prejudice toward immigrants in Italy.
   Students of both Europe and of tolerance will be especially interested
   in the argument that the Left is especially vulnerable to shocks that
   increase prejudice."—Robert D. Putnam

   "The Outsider makes a landmark contribution to our understanding of
   prejudice. Analysts of public opinion, electoral behavior, party
   competition, and ethnicity in the United States and Europe will find
   the book compelling and provocative. The authors integrate and
   reconcile rival theoretical approaches, and they present empirical
   findings of great import. They bring methodological advances pioneered
   in the study of racism in the United States to the study of prejudice
   in Europe. And their discussion of the broader implications of the
   research is magisterial. The book does more than trace the roots of
   hostility toward immigrants in Italy: it illuminates the bases of
   democratic political life. The Outsider is an extraordinarily
   satisfying work of social science."—Carol Mershon, University of
   Virginia

   "The Outsider is an extraordinary book that will be of interest to
   students of politics as well as race and ethnicity. It bears comparison
   to Robert Putnam's Making Democracy Work."—Mabel Berezin, University of
   California, Los Angeles
