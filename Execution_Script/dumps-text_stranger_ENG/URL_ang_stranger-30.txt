Do I Know You? What’s the difference between a stranger and a strange person?

   Is there a “strange” “person stranger” difference in meaning? Yes!

   “Talk to strangers every day!”  I tell my students.  “If you want to
   improve your English more quickly, speak with strangers whenever and
   wherever you can.”

   strange person stranger difference 1

   Often they look shocked.  “I don’t want to talk to strangers,” they
   say.  “I cross the street when I see a stranger.”

   That’s how I know they are probably confused.

   When I say “stranger,” I mean a person they don’t know, a person they
   haven’t met before.

   They think I mean “a strange person,” someone who behaves strangely and
   makes them feel uncomfortable.

   If you sit next to a stranger on a bus or in a coffee shop, start a
   conversation.

   If you sit next to a strange person, you may want to change your seat.

   When you meet a stranger, practice your English.  Make small talk like
   “Nice weather, eh?” or “Long line, huh?”

   strange person stranger difference 3 When you see a strange person, you
   can take a photo for Facebook or Instagram.  For a caption, write “Keep
   Portland Weird.”

   So, try to use this “strange” “person stranger” difference in the real
   world when talking to people in English!
