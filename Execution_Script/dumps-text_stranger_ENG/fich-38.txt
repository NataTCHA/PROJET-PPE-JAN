Stranger vs Foreigner vs Alien vs Outlander vs Outsider vs Immigrant vs
Émigré

   December 11, 2020December 11, 2020 admin Synonyms

   Stranger, foreigner, alien, outlander, outsider, immigrant, émigré can
   all designate a person who comes into a community from the outside and
   is not recognized as a member of that community.

   This is the primary denotation of some of the words, but the secondary
   sense of the others, especially the last three. Stranger and foreigner
   may both apply to one who comes from another country or sometimes from
   another section as a resident or visitor.

   [INS: :INS]

   They have somewhat different implications, however, stranger stressing
   the person's unfamiliarity with the language and customs and foreigner
   the fact that he speaks a different language, follows different
   customs, or bears allegiance to another government.

   Alien emphasizes allegiance to another sovereign or government and is
   often opposed to citizen ; thus, one may be called a foreigner after
   naturalization, but not with accuracy an alien . In extended use alien
   can imply either exclusion from full privileges of or inability to
   identify oneself with a group.

   Outlander , in its general sense, is preferred to foreigner only for a
   literary or rhetorical reason or because it carries the implications
   of outlandish .

   Outsider usually implies nonmembership in a group, clique, or caste
   largely because of essential differences in origin, interests,
   backgrounds, customs, and manners.

   Immigrant and émigré are often used of foreigners who are residents and
   no longer aliens.

   Immigrant usually is applied to a foreigner who has come voluntarily,
   typically in search of a better means of earning a living or a more
   satisfying way of life; émigré implies that the foreigner is a fugitive
   or refugee from his native land or, in a weaker sense, that he has left
   his abiding place rather from dissatisfaction than from strong hope for
   a better future.
