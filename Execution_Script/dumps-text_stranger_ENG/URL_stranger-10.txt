A moment in time: snapshots of 5 strangers for Sit With a Stranger Day

   Meeting new people got a little bit easier on Sept. 16 as National Sit
   With A Stranger Day brought conversations between random people.

   Meeting new people got a little bit easier on Sept. 16 as National Sit
   With A Stranger Day brought conversations between random people.

   Last Friday marked National Sit With a Stranger Day, a holiday created
   in 2020 to encourage people to make new connections with others, even
   if they‚Äôve never met. The following vignettes are stories from people
   who spent their Saturday on Syracuse University‚Äôs campus. From
   volunteers to a new fianc√©, SU was chock full of strangers to sit with,
   learn from and talk to this weekend. And, through these conversations
   with The Daily Orange, may be a little less than strangers now.

   The Tailgaters

   Under an orange tent stationed next to Carnegie Library, Tim Teeter and
   Bob Sullivan got ready for Saturday‚Äôs football game. The pair have been
   tailgating games for over a decade, joined by their wives, Debbie and
   Lisa, and other friends. A cooler of breakfast sandwiches ‚Äî with the
   choice of sausage, egg and cheese and ham, egg and cheese ‚Äî as well as
   Teeter‚Äôs famous chicken dip rounded out the early morning tailgate
   spread.

   The Teeters and Sullivans hold season tickets for SU football. They
   make the drive to home games from Utica with their SU-themed cups and
   orange paraphernalia always in tow. Throughout their time as
   tailgaters, the Teeters, Sullivans and their friends have experimented
   with different dishes from grilled goods to brisket and low country
   boils. Their game day menu is always different, Bob said.

   For the Teeters and Sullivans, the atmosphere of the Dome and energy of
   the crowd are the best part of SU games. Though Bob and Tim didn‚Äôt
   graduate from SU, their love for local college football is enough to
   keep bringing them back season after season.

   ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve had season tickets for 12 years now,‚Äù Bob said. ‚ÄúWe
   tailgate together for the season tickets, so we‚Äôll be together. And
   then some other friends will come and join us, so we might have 15 or
   20 here.‚Äù

   The Cook

   While the tailgaters enjoyed their home cooked goodies, Fred Flagg was
   parked in front of Link Hall preparing to cook hot dogs and hamburgers
   for the pre-game crowd. Flagg is a cook, but also does assorted odd
   jobs, specifically at the Limp Lizard Barbecue food truck. Four hours
   before the game, Flagg cleaned and prepped the flat grill and cooking
   space. He said he arrives early to prepare for the inevitable rush of
   fans about an hour before the game starts.

   Flagg was preparing Limp Lizard‚Äôs walking tacos, one of the truck‚Äôs
   specialties. The dish includes taco meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese
   all tossed inside a bag of Doritos. In the four hours between the
   truck‚Äôs arrival and the beginning of the game, Flagg said he expected
   to stock up on any supplies and ready the space for customers.

   Though he‚Äôs worked at Limp Lizard for only a year, Flagg has been in
   the restaurant industry for over 40. He said the biggest difference
   between working in a food truck and working in a restaurant is that
   people ordering from the truck don‚Äôt have time to wait. Flagg said
   staying focused and knowing what he‚Äôs doing make him successful while
   on the job.

   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost 60 now, I‚Äôve been doing this since I was 17. So you learn
   something in that time,‚Äù Flagg said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun. As long as you know
   what you‚Äôre doing, you stay focused, get some people out and keep them
   happy.‚Äù

   The Volunteer

   Anyone passing by the Dome Saturday could hear the delicate, persistent
   sound of the Salvation Army‚Äôs bells. Kiana Williams, who works for the
   organization through the Booth House teen shelter, said the Salvation
   Army was volunteering at SU as part of a food drive for food insecurity
   in central New York.

   In the six years that Williams has been with the organization, she said
   that SU has been generous to the Salvation Army‚Äôs causes. Williams
   herself is in the process of becoming a social work student at Falk
   College, and said she was glad the organization and school have
   maintained a partnership for donations, especially since the pandemic
   has impacted poverty rates locally, she said.

   ‚ÄúSo many people are struggling, especially after COVID. A lot more
   families have been pushed into poverty, so it‚Äôs more needed now than
   ever,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúWe get donation calls from Syracuse alum or
   former Syracuse students all the time ‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm actually expecting this
   to be a really good turnout for our shelter.‚Äù

   Even though Williams was working on the Quad for Salvation Army, she
   also said she, as a lifelong Syracuse resident, was excited to see if
   SU will continue their momentum throughout the football season. Between
   the work as a volunteer and as a fan, Williams said she was expecting a
   good donation yield for the Salvation Army, and for the football team
   to go 3-0.

   The Football Family

   The Jackson family drove up to Syracuse from Pittsburgh at 4 a.m. for
   the game. Derrick Jackson, whose son, Courtney, is a wide receiver for
   SU‚Äôs football team, has attended almost all of Courtney‚Äôs games this
   season. For the Purdue game, Courtney‚Äôs siblings Chan, Bray and Blake
   tagged along.

   Despite feeling tired from the drive, the family said they were excited
   to watch the game, and to catch up and wish Courtney well afterwards.
   Derrick said the family would have to leave soon after the game to
   drive back to Pittsburgh ‚Äî Blake and Bray, who also play football, had
   a game the next day.

   The Jacksons are planning on coming to the rest of the games this
   season, though they jokingly hoped for more games that start later in
   the day. The family often goes to the locker room to see Jackson after
   the game.

   ‚ÄúWe hang out with (Courtney) a little bit, you know, give him our well
   wishes and then we jump back on the road,‚Äù Derrick said. ‚ÄúRight now,
   this is all about having fun.‚Äù

   The Proposal

   Elsewhere on campus, a white wedding altar decorated in faux flowers
   and tulle flanked the Kissing Bench outside of the Hall of Languages. A
   red carpet led up to the bench, where Donato Fraioli was preparing to
   propose to his girlfriend.

   Fraioli has been with his girlfriend since they met seven years ago
   when they were both SU students. The couple kissed on the bench during
   their time at the school, and Fraioli, who has a video of their kiss,
   planned his proposal idea around that.

   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got actually a little video of us kissing on this bench seven
   years ago,‚Äù Fraioli said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gonna see it on an iPad, I‚Äôm gonna
   have a random person bring it over to her, and then hopefully she‚Äôll
   just, you know, walk up.‚Äù

   With help from his brother, Fraioli was able to surprise his
   girlfriend, first with the video and then by leading her to the
   decorated Kissing Bench to recreate the moment. After seven years
   together, Fraioli said that Saturday was finally ‚Äúthe day‚Äù to propose.
   The weather and timing worked out perfectly, he said,

   When the time came for Fraioli to pop the question, Ed Sheeran‚Äôs
   ‚ÄúThinking Out Loud‚Äù wafted over the scene. She said yes.
