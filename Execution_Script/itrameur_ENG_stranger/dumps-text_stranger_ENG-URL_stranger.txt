A moment in time: snapshots of 5 strangers for Sit With a Stranger Day

   Meeting new people got a little bit easier on Sept. 16 as National Sit
   With A Stranger Day brought conversations between random people.

   Meeting new people got a little bit easier on Sept. 16 as National Sit
   With A Stranger Day brought conversations between random people.

   Last Friday marked National Sit With a Stranger Day, a holiday created
   in 2020 to encourage people to make new connections with others, even
   if they’ve never met. The following vignettes are stories from people
   who spent their Saturday on Syracuse University’s campus. From
   volunteers to a new fiancé, SU was chock full of strangers to sit with,
   learn from and talk to this weekend. And, through these conversations
   with The Daily Orange, may be a little less than strangers now.

   The Tailgaters

   Under an orange tent stationed next to Carnegie Library, Tim Teeter and
   Bob Sullivan got ready for Saturday’s football game. The pair have been
   tailgating games for over a decade, joined by their wives, Debbie and
   Lisa, and other friends. A cooler of breakfast sandwiches — with the
   choice of sausage, egg and cheese and ham, egg and cheese — as well as
   Teeter’s famous chicken dip rounded out the early morning tailgate
   spread.

   The Teeters and Sullivans hold season tickets for SU football. They
   make the drive to home games from Utica with their SU-themed cups and
   orange paraphernalia always in tow. Throughout their time as
   tailgaters, the Teeters, Sullivans and their friends have experimented
   with different dishes from grilled goods to brisket and low country
   boils. Their game day menu is always different, Bob said.

   For the Teeters and Sullivans, the atmosphere of the Dome and energy of
   the crowd are the best part of SU games. Though Bob and Tim didn’t
   graduate from SU, their love for local college football is enough to
   keep bringing them back season after season.

   “I think I’ve had season tickets for 12 years now,” Bob said. “We
   tailgate together for the season tickets, so we’ll be together. And
   then some other friends will come and join us, so we might have 15 or
   20 here.”

   The Cook

   Fred Flagg at the Limp Lizard Barbecue food truck | Emily Steinberger,
   Senior Staff Photographer

   While the tailgaters enjoyed their home cooked goodies, Fred Flagg was
   parked in front of Link Hall preparing to cook hot dogs and hamburgers
   for the pre-game crowd. Flagg is a cook, but also does assorted odd
   jobs, specifically at the Limp Lizard Barbecue food truck. Four hours
   before the game, Flagg cleaned and prepped the flat grill and cooking
   space. He said he arrives early to prepare for the inevitable rush of
   fans about an hour before the game starts.

   Flagg was preparing Limp Lizard’s walking tacos, one of the truck’s
   specialties. The dish includes taco meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese
   all tossed inside a bag of Doritos. In the four hours between the
   truck’s arrival and the beginning of the game, Flagg said he expected
   to stock up on any supplies and ready the space for customers.

   Though he’s worked at Limp Lizard for only a year, Flagg has been in
   the restaurant industry for over 40. He said the biggest difference
   between working in a food truck and working in a restaurant is that
   people ordering from the truck don’t have time to wait. Flagg said
   staying focused and knowing what he’s doing make him successful while
   on the job.

   “I’m almost 60 now, I’ve been doing this since I was 17. So you learn
   something in that time,” Flagg said. “It’s fun. As long as you know
   what you’re doing, you stay focused, get some people out and keep them
   happy.”

   The Volunteer

   Anyone passing by the Dome Saturday could hear the delicate, persistent
   sound of the Salvation Army’s bells. Kiana Williams, who works for the
   organization through the Booth House teen shelter, said the Salvation
   Army was volunteering at SU as part of a food drive for food insecurity
   in central New York.

   In the six years that Williams has been with the organization, she said
   that SU has been generous to the Salvation Army’s causes. Williams
   herself is in the process of becoming a social work student at Falk
   College, and said she was glad the organization and school have
   maintained a partnership for donations, especially since the pandemic
   has impacted poverty rates locally, she said.

   “So many people are struggling, especially after COVID. A lot more
   families have been pushed into poverty, so it’s more needed now than
   ever,” Williams said. “We get donation calls from Syracuse alum or
   former Syracuse students all the time … so I’m actually expecting this
   to be a really good turnout for our shelter.”

   Even though Williams was working on the Quad for Salvation Army, she
   also said she, as a lifelong Syracuse resident, was excited to see if
   SU will continue their momentum throughout the football season. Between
   the work as a volunteer and as a fan, Williams said she was expecting a
   good donation yield for the Salvation Army, and for the football team
   to go 3-0.

   The Football Family

   The Jackson family drove up to Syracuse from Pittsburgh at 4 a.m. for
   the game. Derrick Jackson, whose son, Courtney, is a wide receiver for
   SU’s football team, has attended almost all of Courtney’s games this
   season. For the Purdue game, Courtney’s siblings Chan, Bray and Blake
   tagged along.

   Despite feeling tired from the drive, the family said they were excited
   to watch the game, and to catch up and wish Courtney well afterwards.
   Derrick said the family would have to leave soon after the game to
   drive back to Pittsburgh — Blake and Bray, who also play football, had
   a game the next day.

   The Jacksons are planning on coming to the rest of the games this
   season, though they jokingly hoped for more games that start later in
   the day. The family often goes to the locker room to see Jackson after
   the game.

   “We hang out with (Courtney) a little bit, you know, give him our well
   wishes and then we jump back on the road,” Derrick said. “Right now,
   this is all about having fun.”

   The Proposal

   Elsewhere on campus, a white wedding altar decorated in faux flowers
   and tulle flanked the Kissing Bench outside of the Hall of Languages. A
   red carpet led up to the bench, where Donato Fraioli was preparing to
   propose to his girlfriend.

   Fraioli has been with his girlfriend since they met seven years ago
   when they were both SU students. The couple kissed on the bench during
   their time at the school, and Fraioli, who has a video of their kiss,
   planned his proposal idea around that.

   “I’ve got actually a little video of us kissing on this bench seven
   years ago,” Fraioli said. “She’s gonna see it on an iPad, I’m gonna
   have a random person bring it over to her, and then hopefully she’ll
   just, you know, walk up.”

   With help from his brother, Fraioli was able to surprise his
   girlfriend, first with the video and then by leading her to the
   decorated Kissing Bench to recreate the moment. After seven years
   together, Fraioli said that Saturday was finally “the day” to propose.
   The weather and timing worked out perfectly, he said,

   When the time came for Fraioli to pop the question, Ed Sheeran’s
   “Thinking Out Loud” wafted over the scene. She said yes.

Feeling friendly to a stranger

   Feeling friendly to a stranger. September. 24, 2022 07:27. by Yang-Hwan
   Jung ray@donga.com.
   It surely is one of the most overwhelming book titles I've encountered
   this year. The author says you should make the first move and "talk to
   a stranger" when it would feel uncomfortable even to be talked to by a
   stranger. I don't even tell my kids to talk to strangers first. I just
   know that I would never be able to do what the author recommends even
   if what he says is completely right and convincing.
   The writer must have predicted reactions such as I had. As a freelance
   journalist operating in the U.S., he says the conversation with a
   stranger is not just a way of life but a survival strategy. He even
   says that humanity has evolved by welcoming, communicating, and
   building relationships with strangers. At this point when he invokes
   our great forefathers, it's hard not to reconsider what he has to say.
   It is challenging to talk to someone you don't know in a society where
   people are busy staring into their smartphones in the subway and
   elsewhere. You might even be wrongfully accused of being a pervert or a
   crazy person. The author, however, insists that if you look into that
   stranger's eyes, find petty stuff in common, and successfully make a
   conversation, then a "whole new world" will unfold in front of you,
   just like in a movie. The author believes that deep down, everyone
   wants to be talked to.
   The book's publisher may disagree, but if you are busy, you can skip
   Parts 1 and 2 and just read Part 3 to get the gist. Despite numerous
   appealing sentences, the first two parts have no distinct conclusions
   so that you may think, "so what?" Part 3, however, contains the
   author's anecdotal experiences of talking to strangers. They are pretty
   helpful as they offer you the tips and right "skills" to strike a
   successful conversation with a stranger. The author has a knack for
   making you laugh at first and then inspiring you right on with those
   anecdotes.
   As I said, even though what the author says is convincing, it may be
   difficult to implement immediately. The world would be perfect if
   everything were so easy to follow. Still, those passers-by you
   encounter on the bus or on the street may feel different once you
   finish the book. At the end of the day, we are all lonely individuals
   isolated on each of our own islands. One day, I will talk to a stranger
   first, with the help of propranolol, of course.

   “Asking for help is hardly ever as bad as you imagine it will be,” says
   Vanessa Bohns, a social psychologist and associate professor of
   organizational behavior at Cornell University. For research purposes,
   she and colleagues have sent help-seekers out into cities all over the
   world to request things from 15,000 strangers. Appealing for assistance
   “feels socially risky,” Bohns says. Ask anyway. When asked for help,
   most people are happy to comply. “We are a social species,” Bohns says.
   “We default to being agreeable rather than disagreeable.”

   Keep your request simple and direct. “Don’t offer a million excuses and
   apologies,” she says. To avoid potential rejection, you might feel
   inclined to passively hint at what you need rather than saying it
   outright. Don’t do that. Ask directly for what you need, and if someone
   says no, move on and ask another person. Whether you’re approaching a
   stranger or a friend, it’s always more effective to ask for help in
   person. “Be face to face,” Bohns says. “It’s more emotional.”

   Assume the stranger will help you. In one study, Bohns and a colleague
   had undergraduates approach people they didn’t know and say, “Can I use
   your cellphone to make a call?” Before starting, the undergrads had to
   predict how many people they would have to ask to get three to agree;
   they overestimated by more than 60 percent. It turned out that about
   half the strangers shared their phone. The help-seeker tends to believe
   people will weigh the time and financial costs associated with offering
   assistance, but it turns out saying no is awkward, and most people
   would rather just say yes, even when the request feels ethically
   questionable. In another study, Bohns had people ask strangers to write
   the word “pickle” in a library book. Many were reluctant and
   uncomfortable, but ultimately some 65 percent of them vandalized the
   book anyway.

   Try not to seek help from strangers in a location where others are
   simultaneously approaching them with requests. The only place that
   Bohns found where strangers mostly refused to help was a busy street in
   Toronto frequented by canvassers and petitioners. People steel
   themselves in those kinds of scenarios. “It’s easier to say no when you
   know what’s coming,” she says.

   National Sit with a Stranger Day is observed on September 16 of each

   all ages and gender to strike up a conversation with a random stranger
   for the sole purpose of seeing things from the perspective of others.

   In an era where lockdowns have become the norm, National Sit with a
   Stranger Day was created by the B.DOPE L.L.C. team, a bottled water
   company that is creating a catalyst for optimism, encouragement, and
   relationships. The day presents a splendid opportunity to start a
   random, friendly conversation with someone and make a new connection.

History of National Sit With a Stranger Day

   A stranger is generally portrayed as an outsider and a figure of
   uncertainty because they could be a friend, an enemy, or both. This
   makes them a potential source of conflict. The origin of the word
   ‘stranger’ can be traced back to the Middle French word ‘estrangier,’
   which meant a foreigner or an alien.

   The term ‘strangers’ was first used about the time that the textile
   industry was beginning to flourish in the 15th century. This was the
   oldest known instance of its use. Strong trading linkages and
   relatively unnoticed immigration caused several settlements to relocate
   from one location to another in pursuit of greener pastures. By the
   16th century, new European areas like the Netherlands, Belgium, and
   France had begun to create goods that were both cheaper and of a higher
   quality than those produced in older European nations.

   Because of this, another migration took place, during which skilled
   immigrants moved to areas that were abundant in textile materials and
   began instructing local employees on how to manufacture new sorts of
   cloth. The high level of workmanship and originality displayed by the
   skilled immigrants prompted city authorities in England to write a
   letter to Queen Elizabeth I pleading for the monarch’s authorization to
   allow immigrant workers to permanently stay in England. In addition,
   the political climate in Spain at the time was hostile against
   Protestants, which led thousands of people to leave the country in
   search of religious freedom in other countries.

   In the year 1565, the city of Norwich granted permission to Protestant
   refugees from the Spanish Netherlands to settle so that they could help
   the city’s textile industry. The rapid expansion of the ‘stranger’
   community led to the city of Norwich having over 4,000 Dutch and
   Walloon residents by the year 1620. This represented approximately
   one-fourth of the whole population of the city and led to an
   astronomical increase in England’s economic value.

National Sit With a Stranger Day FAQs

What does it mean when you meet a stranger?

   If you meet someone, you happen to be in the same place as them and
   start talking to them. You may know the other person, but be surprised
   to see them, or you may not know them at all.

How do you safely meet a stranger?

   If you’re planning to meet a stranger for the first time, the first
   step is to stay in communication with someone you know about who you’re
   meeting and where you will be meeting the stranger. If possible, ensure
   your first meeting is in a public place. If you don’t feel very
   comfortable going alone, you can take a friend who can live once it’s
   safe.

How do you talk to a stranger without being awkward?

   To easily engage in conversation, you have to be brave and try not to
   overthink or micro-analyze things. Ask genuine questions and throw in a
   compliment when necessary. Focus on things you both have in common and
   try not to let awkward moments ruin the flow.

National Sit With a Stranger Day Activities

    1.

Visit a public spot
       Find a spot in a park or another public place and take a seat. If

       not, enjoy some peace and quiet.
    2.

Join a social conversation
       Join a meetup group or online forum that focuses on meeting new

    3.

Make a random connection
       Strike up a conversation with the person sitting next to you on the
       bus, train, or in line at the grocery store. Small talk can be a
       great way to break the ice and get to know someone a little better.

5 Facts About Immigration That Are Mind-Blowing

    1.

There are more immigrant men than women
       Men tend to migrate far more easily due to financial duties, and a
       man will frequently travel to seek better pastures or a means to
       meet family obligations.
    2.

Immigration raises economic output
       According to analysts, foreign-born workers contribute almost two
       trillion dollars to the yearly G.D.P.
    3.

American immigrants are majorly Latino or Asian
       While there is still significant European migration to America,
       approximately 80% of U.S. immigrants are from Latin America and
       Asia.
    4.

The 19th Century saw massive migration
       Based on the current global population, more individuals were
       moving during the end of the 19th century than at present.
    5.

The first green card had green stripes
       The first 'green card,' issued in the 1950s following World War II,
       was a war form printed on green paper.

Lost in Translation: What the First Line of “The Stranger” Should Be

   Lost in Translation What the First Line of “The Stranger” Should Be
     *

     * Save this story for later.

   For the modern American reader, few lines in French literature are as
   famous as the opening of Albert Camus’s “L’Étranger”: “Aujourd’hui,
   maman est morte.” Nitty-gritty tense issues aside, the first sentence
   of “The Stranger” is so elementary that even a schoolboy with a base
   knowledge of French could adequately translate it. So why do the pros
   keep getting it wrong?

   Within the novel’s first sentence, two subtle and seemingly minor
   translation decisions have the power to change the way we read
   everything that follows. What makes these particular choices prickly is
   that they poke at a long-standing debate among the literary community:
   whether it is necessary for a translator to have some sort of special
   affinity with a work’s author in order to produce the best possible
   text.

   Arthur Goldhammer, translator of a volume of Camus’s Combat editorials,
   calls it “nonsense” to believe that “good translation requires some
   sort of mystical sympathy between author and translator.” While
   “mystical” may indeed be a bit of a stretch, it’s hard to look at
   Camus’s famous first sentence—whether translated by Stuart Gilbert,
   Joseph Laredo, Kate Griffith, or even, to a lesser degree, Matthew
   Ward—without thinking that a little more understanding between author
   and translator may have prevented the text from being colored in ways
   that Camus never intended.

   Stuart Gilbert, a British scholar and a friend of James Joyce, was the
   first person to attempt Camus’s “L’Étranger” in English. In 1946,
   Gilbert translated the book’s title as “The Outsider” and rendered the
   first line as “Mother died today.” Simple, succinct, and incorrect.

   In 1982, both Joseph Laredo and Kate Griffith produced new translations
   of “L’Étranger,” each opting for Gilbert’s revised title, “The
   Stranger,” but preserving his first line. “Mother died today” remained,
   and it wasn’t until 1988 that the line saw a single word changed. It
   was then that American translator and poet Matthew Ward reverted
   “Mother” back to Maman. One word? What’s the big deal? A large part of
   how we view and—alongside the novel’s court—ultimately judge Meursault
   lies in our perception of his relationship with his mother. We condemn
   or set him free based not on the crime he commits but on our assessment
   of him as a person. Does he love his mother? Or is he cold toward her,
   uncaring, even?

   First impressions matter, and, for forty-two years, the way that
   American readers were introduced to Meursault was through the detached
   formality of his statement: “Mother died today.” There is little
   warmth, little bond or closeness or love in “Mother,” which is a
   static, archetypal term, not the sort of thing we use for a living,
   breathing being with whom we have close relations. To do so would be
   like calling the family dog “Dog” or a husband “Husband.” The word
   forces us to see Meursault as distant from the woman who bore him.

   What if the opening line had read, “Mommy died today”? How would we
   have seen Meursault then? Likely, our first impression would have been
   of a child speaking. Rather than being put off, we would have felt pity
   or sympathy. But this, too, would have presented an inaccurate view of
   Meursault. The truth is that neither of these translations—“Mother” or
   “Mommy”—ring true to the original. The French word maman hangs
   somewhere between the two extremes: it’s neither the cold and distant
   “mother” nor the overly childlike “mommy.” In English, “mom” might seem
   the closest fit for Camus’s sentence, but there’s still something
   off-putting and abrupt about the single-syllable word; the two-syllable
   maman has a touch of softness and warmth that is lost with “mom.”

   So how is the English-language translator to avoid unnecessarily
   influencing the reader? It seems that Matthew Ward, the novel’s most
   recent translator, did the only logical thing: nothing. He left Camus’s
   word untouched, rendering the famous first line, “Maman died today.” It
   could be said that Ward introduces a new problem: now, right from the
   start, the American reader is faced with a foreign term, with a
   confusion not previously present. Ward’s translation is clever, though,
   and three reasons demonstrate why his is the best solution.

   First, the French word maman is familiar enough for an English-language
   reader to parse. Around the globe, as children learn to form words by
   babbling, they begin with the simplest sounds. In many languages,
   bilabials such as “m,” “p,” and “b,” as well as the low vowel “a,” are
   among the easiest to produce. As a result, in English, we find that
   children initially refer to the female parent as “mama.” Even in a
   language as seemingly different as Mandarin Chinese, we find māma; in
   the languages of Southern India we get amma, and in Norwegian, Italian,
   Swedish, and Icelandic, as well as many other languages, the word used
   is “mamma.” The French maman is so similar that the English-language
   reader will effortlessly understand it.

   As the years pass, new generations of American readers, who often first
   encounter Camus’s book in high school, grow more and more removed from
   the novel’s historical context. Utilizing the original French word in
   the first sentence rather than any of the English options also serves
   to remind readers that they are in fact entering a world different from
   their own. While this hint may not be enough to inform the younger
   reader that, for example, the likelihood of a Frenchman in colonial
   Algeria getting the death penalty for killing an armed Arab was slim to
   nonexistent, at least it provides an initial allusion to these
   extra-textual facts.

   Finally, and perhaps most important, the American reader will harbor no
   preconceived notions of the word maman. We will understand it with
   ease, but it will carry no baggage, it will plant no unintended seeds
   in our head. The word will neither sway us to see Meursault as overly
   cold and heartless nor as overly warm and loving. And while some of the
   word’s precision is indeed lost for the English-language reader, maman
   still gives us a more neutral-to-familiar tone than “mother,” one that
   hews closer to Camus’s original.

   So if Matthew Ward finally corrected the mother problem, what exactly
   has he, and the other translators, gotten wrong? Writing of “The
   Stranger” ’s first line in the Guardian, Guy Dammann says, “Some
   openers are so prescient that they seem to burn a hole through the rest
   of the book, the semantic resonance recurring with the persistence of
   the first theme in Beethoven’s fifth symphony.”

   The linguistic fluency of any good translator tells them that,
   syntactically, “Aujourd’hui, maman est morte,” is not the most fluid
   English sentence. So rather than the more literal translation, “Today,
   Mother has died,” we get, “Mother died today,” which is the smoother,
   more natural rendering. But the question is: In changing the sentence’s
   syntax, are we also changing its logic, its “mystical” deeper meaning?

   The answer is a resounding oui!

   Rendering the line as “Mother died today” completely neglects a
   specific ordering of ideas that offer insight into Meursault’s inner
   psyche. Throughout the course of the novel, the reader comes to see
   that Meursault is a character who, first and foremost, lives for the
   moment. He does not consciously dwell on the past; he does not worry
   about the future. What matters is today. The single most important
   factor of his being is right now.

   Not far behind, though, is Maman. Reflective of Camus’s life, Meursault
   shares a unique relationship with his mother, due in part to her
   inability to communicate (Camus’s own mother was illiterate, partially
   deaf, and had trouble speaking). Both Camus and Meursault yearn for
   Maman, for her happiness and love, but find the expression of these
   emotions difficult. Rather than distancing mother from son, though,
   this tension puts Maman at the center of her son’s life. As the book
   opens, the loss of Maman places her between Meursault’s ability to live
   for today and his recognition of a time when there will no longer be a
   today.

   This loss drives the action of the novel, leading inexorably to the
   end, the final period, the thing that hangs over all else: death. Early
   in the book, Camus links the death of Meursault’s mother with the
   oppressive, ever-present sun, so that when we get to the climactic
   beach scene, we see the symbolism: sun equals loss of mother, sun
   causes Meursault to pull the trigger. In case we don’t get it, though,
   Camus makes the connection explicit, writing, “It was the same sun as
   on the day I buried Maman and, like then, my forehead especially was
   hurting me, all of the veins pulsating together beneath the skin.” As
   the trigger gives way, so, too, does today, the beginning—through the
   loss of Maman—succumb to death, the end.

   The ordering of words in Camus’s first sentence is no accident: today
   is interrupted by Maman’s death. The sentence, the one we have yet to
   see correctly rendered in an English translation of “L’Étranger,”
   should read: “Today, Maman died.”

     * Cope With Conversation Challenges

   Some people can strike up a conversation with anyone—even complete
   strangers. But many others find it difficult to talk to a stranger.
   This can be particularly stressful if you have social anxiety disorder
   (SAD). But even if social small talk is hard for you, it is possible to
   improve your conversational skills and feel more comfortable talking
   with strangers. The best way to do this is to practice.

   Your initial goal is to make an introductory statement, which does not
   have to be complex. The point of that first comment is to open the
   door, and to give you the chance to say something else once the person
   responds.
   Starting a Conversation If You Have Social Anxiety

Comment on Something Personal

   You'll find that everyone you meet has something unique about
   them—an item of jewelry, an unusual shirt, or even a tattoo. These tell
   a story about a person. When you notice and compliment them, it can
   give you a starting point for conversation.

   For example, you could initiate a conversation by saying:
     * "Wow, that is a beautiful pendant. What kind of stone is that?"
     * "Nice shirt! You're a Grateful Dead fan?"
     * "Is that a tattoo of Yoda on your shoulder?"

   Avoid commenting on intimate aspects of a person's appearance, such as
   asking, "Is that your real hair color?" or "Wow, you must work out a
   lot!"

   After you receive a response, make sure you have something else to say.
   That will give you a common platform on which to build a conversation
   and, ultimately, a relationship with the person you've just met, even
   if the relationship only lasts a few minutes.

   Offer a follow-up story that reveals a bit of personal information
   about you. For example, when the person responds to your initial
   question, you could follow up with something like:
     * "I saw a pendant like that at a bazaar in India."
     * "My father was a real Deadhead. He took me to see them when I was a
       kid."
     * "I love tattoos. I've been thinking of getting one but I'm not sure
       what to get. How did you decide on Yoda?"

   These statements will help connect you to the person and keep the
   conversation moving. Remember, the goal is not to say the perfect thing
   or to come across a certain way, but to keep talking.
   How to Ask Small Talk Follow-Up Questions

Ask If You've Met Before

   This classic conversation starter can work in the right circumstances.
   If you say to someone, "You seem really familiar, do I know you from
   somewhere?" it makes it easier to gather and give information and keep
   a conversation going.

   For example, if you ask someone where they went to high school and it
   turns out you went to the same school, you could follow up by offering
   a fact like, "I was in the marching band. Did you play an instrument?"

   If you ask someone where they work and realize that you have seen them
   there, it gives you the opportunity to make a connection: "I love that
   Starbucks!"

   As the other person is giving information about themselves to you, it's
   OK to go off on interesting tangents. Remember: the goal is not to find
   out if you've met before, it's to get to know the other person.

Break the Ice With Humor

   Another great way to start a conversation with the people around you is
   to simply comment on your shared surroundings. A little humor works
   great here.

   For example, if you are sitting in a lecture hall and notice that your
   professor looks familiar, you could say to the person next to you,
   "Doesn't he look a bit like Harry Potter?"

   Keep your commentary positive—never mean-spirited or judgmental. You
   want the other person to feel comfortable getting in on the joke with
   you. You could follow up on your previous comment about your professor
   with something like, "I wonder where Hedwig is?"

   Humor is difficult with someone you don't know well, which means using
   this method to start a conversation can be risky. However, if you do
   find someone who shares your sense of humor, it can be the start of a
   great friendship.

   If you don't receive a positive response from one person, the method
   might work with someone else. The more you practice, the easier it will
   be to talk to a person you don't know. With time, you'll become more
   confident and won't need to rely on tricks to get a conversation
   started and keep it going.
   Small Talk Topics

Keep the Conversation Going

   You might participate less in a conversation because your anxiety makes
   you too uncomfortable and self-conscious or because you don't have
   experience making conversation. But a 2016 study showed that people
   with social anxiety tend not to contribute equally to conversations. As
   a result, they are less well-liked than others.

   So it's important to hold up your end of a conversation once you start
   it. Many people can do this with people they know, but they are
   self-conscious with strangers. Their anxiety holds them back and
   prevents them from being their true selves.

Cope With Conversation Challenges

   Lacking certain social skills can inhibit your ability to engage others
   in conversation, especially if it makes you seem unfriendly. For
   example, research shows that people with social anxiety tend to make
   less eye contact during conversation.

   Working on making and keeping eye contact when you are talking to
   others will help you appear more approachable and friendly. This will
   make it more likely people will respond to your attempts to start a
   conversation.

   If you feel that you don't have the social skills and experience needed
   to be a good conversationalist, self-help books and working with a
   therapist can help you develop them.

   While it's important not to avoid conversations with strangers because
   they make you feel anxious, your safety also matters. Practice talking
   to strangers in safe, public environments where the stakes are low. And
   if you are chatting with someone online, always protect your personal
   information.

A Word From Verywell

   Strategies for starting a conversation and being more comfortable
   around others will work best if you are able to work on and manage your
   underlying anxiety. With time, practice, and the right treatment, you
   can gain confidence and improve your conversation skills. If you have
   social anxiety, you might find that treatment with cognitive-behavioral
   therapy or medication helps you feel more at ease in social settings.

Stranger Danger

Who is a Stranger?

     * A stranger is anyone you don't know.
     * Strangers can be men, women or teenagers.
     * If you have never met them before, they are strangers!
     * Although there are kind strangers, some strangers are not always
       kind and some can hurt you.
     * There is no way to tell if someone is good just by looking at them.
       Bad people can pretend to be nice too.
     * Don't be fooled! Just stay away.

When a Stranger tries to talk to you

     * Do not look at them or acknowledge that they have spoken to you,
       ignore them.
     * Walk quickly or run away from them in the opposite direction as
       fast as you can.
     * Go to a home of someone you know or to an area that has a lot of
       people.
     * Tell an adult you can trust about what happened, like a parent, a
       teacher, a police officer, or some other grownup your parents said
       you can talk to.

Keeping Safe Tips

     * Always tell your parents where you are going.
     * Try not to walk anywhere alone. Walk with a friend or two.
     * Don't take shortcuts through the woods or empty lots.
     * Do not get close to strangers. Make sure you have room to run.
     * Don't tell your name or address to a stranger.
     * Know how and when to call 9-1-1.
     * Never open the door to a stranger.
     * Never tell anyone on the phone you are alone.
     * Never take candy, money or gifts from a stranger.
     * Never go with a stranger to help look for a lost pet or play a
       game.
     * Never get into a car with anyone you don't know.
     * If a stranger follows you or grabs for you, yell really loud.
       Shout, "I don't know you," so other people know you are in trouble.
       Fight back and make as much noise as you can.
     * If anyone touches you in a bad way, say "NO" as loudly as you can
       and run away. Tell an adult immediately.
     * Talk to your parents and come up with a secret code word for
       emergencies

When you are at home alone

     * Keep all the doors and windows locked and don't let anyone know you
       are home alone.
     * If someone rings your doorbell, look through a peephole or window
       to see who it is. If you do not recognize them, don't open the
       door! Even if they are saying it is an emergency and they need to
       use to phone or come inside, do not open the door.
     * If someone calls and asks for your parents, do not tell them you
       are home alone. Tell the person your mom or dad can't come to the
       phone right now, but you will take a message and they will return
       the call later. Tell them this even if your parent(s) is gone for
       an hour or more. If you have caller ID and do not recognize the
       name or phone number on the phone, don't answer it.

Stranger Tricks

   Strangers who are bad people and want to hurt you have developed some
   pretty tricky things to do to confuse you and get you alone with them.
     * First, there is the "Help Trick". This is when a stranger asks you
       to help them find a lost pet or maybe asks you for directions to
       get somewhere.
     * The next trick is called the "Emergency Trick". A stranger will
       tell you that there is an emergency in your family and your mom or
       dad asked them to get you. The stranger may even say that your mom
       or dad got hurt.
     * Another trick strangers try is the "Accident Trick". This is when a
       stranger lays on the ground and looks like they have been injured,
       are unconscious, or in pain. Do not go over to the person! They can
       grab you and take you away. Instead, go to someone you know and
       tell them or call 911 for help.
     * The "Animal Trick" is another one that is hard to resist. This is
       when a stranger holds a small animal and invites you to pet it. You
       are close enough for this stranger to discard the animal and grab
       you.
     * The last is called the "Bribe Trick". This is when a stranger
       promises you candy, money or something else of interest. People do
       not give gifts to people they do not know.

What to Do When a Stranger Annoys You

   In every life, we are constantly confronted with situations where a
   stranger will do something acutely irritating or discomforting: perhaps
   they’ll turn up their music too loudly on the train, or they’ll be
   wiggling their leg maddeningly next to us on the plane. Maybe they’ll
   assign us a room in a hotel that has a strange musty smell or where a
   high pitched whine will be coming out of the air conditioning. In a
   restaurant, we may be given the worst table by the toilets, the bread
   may be stale and, proverbially, a fly may be found floating in the
   soup.

   For many of us, our upbringing and cultural traditions will prepare us
   to say nothing at all in relation to these frustrations, and to forgive
   and overlook our agony instead. We may have emerged from childhood with
   a deep sense that we must – whatever happens – stay quiet and not cause
   a fuss for other people.

   At the same time, we may inwardly twitch and boil. At points, we might
   even explode into sudden unpredictable rage. Though normally shy, we
   might surprise ourselves with the unbounded fury we let loose at the
   car rental resk, the hotel reception and with the hooded teenager in
   the train.

   But neither the silence nor the rage seem, on reflection, to be quite
   the way forward. What we’re ideally searching for is a way to be at
   once polite and honest, or civil and forthright.

   To achieve this, we should – first and foremost – build up a good
   relationship with our own needs. This involves accepting that not
   everything that makes us happy will please others or be honoured as
   especially convenient – but that it can be important to explore and
   hold on to what we want nevertheless. The desire to be unfussy is one
   of the loveliest things in the world, but in order to have a genuinely
   good life, we may sometimes need to be (by the standards of the good
   child we once were) fruitfully and bravely a bit tricky.

   At the same time, in order not to shout, we must hold on, even in very
   challenging situations, to a distinction between what someone does –
   and what they meant to do. Our idea of motives is crucial.
   Unfortunately, we’re seldom very good at perceiving what motives really
   happen to be involved in the incidents that drive us mad. We are easily
   and wildly mistaken. We see intention where there was none and escalate
   and confront when no strenuous or agitated response is warranted.

   Part of the reason why we jump so readily to dark conclusions and
   therefore shout more than we should, is a rather poignant psychological
   phenomenon: self-hatred. The less we like ourselves, the more we appear
   in our own eyes as really rather plausible targets for mockery and
   harm. Why would a drill have started up outside, just as we were
   settling down to work? Why is the room service breakfast not arriving,
   even though we will have to be in a meeting very soon? Why would the
   phone operator be taking so long to find our details? Because there is
   – logically enough – a plot against us. Because we are appropriate
   targets for these kinds of things, because we are the sort of people
   against whom disruptive drilling is legitimately likely to be directed:
   because it’s what we deserve. When we carry an excess of self-disgust
   around with us, operating just below the radar of conscious awareness,
   we’ll constantly seek confirmation from the wider world that we really
   are the worthless people we take ourselves to be.

   The ideal complaint emerges from an unparanoid assumption: they aren’t
   deliberately setting out to irritate us; they haven’t got a plan to
   make us unhappy, they really just haven’t thought about us very much at
   all. We’re able to imagine that they could be quite a nice and
   reasonable person who nevertheless – without thinking about it – has
   upset us profoundly.

   Sorry to be a bore, I’m sure you don’t realise but the back of your
   seat is squashing against my knees.

   Apologies for interrupting, I can’t help overhearing more of your
   conversation than I should.

   I rather love this song as well, but at the moment, I need to get some
   sleep.

   I know it’s not your fault, but a fly does seem to have entangled
   itself in the minestrone.

   The actual words hardly matter, what counts is the lightness of tone
   that comes from an impression of the legitimacy of one’s position and
   of the innocence of those who annoy us most. Viewed in this way,
   complaining is not an insult, it’s an ambitious, authentic and
   ultimately kind attempt to offer someone a small bit of education.

5 Ways To Help A Stranger

   When was the last time you stopped to help a stranger? Every time you
   leave your home you are bound to encounter a stranger. And you are
   likely to encounter a stranger that needs your help.

   Here are five simple ways you can help a stranger by showing kindness:

   1. Smile- A simple smile can brighten someone's day and turn a crummy
   day around.

   2. Pass up a close parking spot- I have recently started passing up
   parking spots so someone else can park close. I often hope this will
   help an expectant mother, an elderly person or someone with small
   children. Plus, I can always use the exercise!

   3. Leave a BIG tip- My husband and I dine out once a week and I'm
   always appreciative of the pleasant and attentive wait staff. This is a
   difficult job and sometimes I like to leave a BIG tip as I figure a
   little extra money never hurt anyone. You never know what difference
   $10, $20 or more could make in a person's life.

   4. Hold a door- I know this one sounds simple but I can't tell you how
   many times I've had a door whack me in the face because the person in
   front of me opened the door and just kept moving. Especially holding
   doors for parents with children/strollers, those in
   wheelchairs/scooters and people with their arms full. I always love to
   see someone approaching a door and I wait to hold it open for them.
   They usually get a little hop in their step, smile and say, 'Thanks so
   much!' I also make sure when children hold the door open for me I show
   appreciation and let them know it was a kind gesture.

   5. Stop and look around- In 2011 I started a giving journey. A mission
   to give a gift every day. The biggest thing the journey taught me is
   that we are busy. We are all moving very fast and have blinders on most
   of the time. I think one of the best ways for all of us to help each
   other out is to slow down and look around. I'm amazed at the need all
   around if I just stop and look for it. I guarantee when you look you,
   will recognize how you are to help out a stranger.

   I always love to end with a challenge, so the next time you encounter a
   stranger needing help, lend a hand and share your story with us. I'd
   also appreciate it if you would share this blog with friends and
   family. They may just need an idea on how to help a stranger.

Summary

   On June 2, 2000, the Jubilee Day for Migrants and Refugees, Pope John
   Paul II celebrated the Eucharist in St. Peter's Square for over 50,000
   migrants, refugees, people on the move, and their chaplains from all
   over the world. The Eucharist drew that great diversity of people into
   unity in the communion of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, realizing a
   Jubilee Year hope for the Church: "to gather into one the dispersed
   children of God," "to sum up all things in Christ, in heaven and on
   earth" (Jn 11:52; Eph 1:10).
   Unity in diversity is the vision that we bishops, as pastors of the
   Church in the United States, offer to our people as they welcome the
   new immigrants and refugees who come to our shores. In the past
   thirty-five years the number and variety of immigrants coming to the
   United States have provided a great challenge for us as pastors.
   Previous immigrants had come predominantly from Europe or as slaves
   from Africa, but many of the new immigrants come from Latin America and
   the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific Islands, the Middle East, Africa,
   Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Though a
   good number come as skilled workers and professionals, the greater
   number come as refugees and immigrants on the edge of survival; large
   numbers join families already here; others arrive without proper
   documents. Many were forced to leave their homeland because of a
   well-founded fear of persecution. This diversity of ethnicity,
   education, and social class challenges us as pastors to welcome these
   new immigrants and help them join our communities in ways that are
   respectful of their cultures and in ways that mutually enrich the
   immigrants and the receiving Church.
   To pursue this vision of unity in diversity, we have chosen the way
   marked out by Pope John Paul II as he stood beneath the figure of Our
   Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City on January 22, 1999, and announced the
   summary of Ecclesia in America: namely, the call to conversion,
   communion, and solidarity.
   The presence of so many people of so many different cultures and
   religions in so many different parts of the United States has
   challenged us as a Church to a profound conversion so that we can
   become truly a sacrament of unity. We reject the anti-immigrant stance
   that has become popular in different parts of our country, and the
   nativism, ethnocentricity, and racism that continue to reassert
   themselves in our communities. We are challenged to get beyond ethnic
   communities living side by side within our own parishes without any
   connection with each other. We are challenged to become an evangelizing
   Church open to interreligious dialogue and willing to proclaim the
   Gospel to those who wish to hear it. The new immigrants call most of us
   back to our ancestral heritage as descendants of immigrants and to our
   baptismal heritage as members of the body of Christ."For in one Spirit
   we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or
   free persons, and we are all given to drink of one Spirit" (1 Cor
   12:13).
   The call to communion goes out to all members of the Church—bishops,
   priests, deacons, religious, lay leaders, and parishioners—to prepare
   themselves to receive the newcomers with a genuine spirit of welcome.
   Simple, grace-filled kindness and concern on the part of all
   parishioners to newcomers are the first steps. This can be accompanied
   by language and culture study as well as constant and patient efforts
   at intercultural communication. The integration of incoming groups is
   complex because of multiple Mass schedules and lack of personnel or
   resources, but if the receiving parish staffs and parishioners are open
   to the newcomers and provide a bridge to join cultures to one another,
   the newcomers themselves will provide the leadership and show the way
   to a healthy integration. Both on parish and diocesan levels, the
   presence of brothers and sisters from different cultures should be
   celebrated as a gift to the Church through well-prepared liturgies, lay
   leadership development programs inclusive of all, the appointment of
   prepared leaders of immigrant communities to parish and diocesan
   positions, and special efforts to help youth find their way as they
   experience themselves often torn between two cultures.
   One successful model of unity in diversity was Encuentro 2000: Many
   Faces in God's House, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops'
   celebration for the Jubilee Year. In the materials prior to the
   celebration, Encuentro 2000 offered a discussion method called the
   "mutual invitation process," which maximizes intercultural
   participation. In the celebration itself, Encuentro 2000 was an
   experience of the exuberance and vitality, the profound faith and
   devotional life of the participants. Encuentro 2000 also demonstrated
   that communion in a multicultural Church is a true possibility for the
   new millennium.
   The call to solidarity can be summed up in Pope John Paul II's Message
   for World Migration Day 2000: "The Church hears the suffering cry of
   all who are uprooted from their own land, of families forcefully
   separated, of those who, in the rapid changes of our day, are unable to
   find a stable home anywhere. She senses the anguish of those without
   rights, without any security, at the mercy of every kind of
   exploitation, and she supports them in their unhappiness" (no. 6). We
   bishops commit ourselves and all the members of our church communities
   to continue the work of advocacy for laws that respect the human rights
   of immigrants and preserve the unity of the immigrant family. We
   encourage the extension of social services, citizenship classes,
   community organizing efforts that secure improved housing conditions,
   decent wages, better medical attention, and appropriate educational
   opportunities for immigrants and refugees. We advocate reform of the
   1996 immigration laws that have undermined some basic human rights for
   immigrants. We join with others of good will in a call for legalization
   opportunities for the maximum number of undocumented persons,
   particularly those who have built equities and otherwise contributed to
   their communities.
   In Ecclesia in America, Pope John Paul II calls for a "new
   evangelization" centered on the person of Jesus Christ. "‘The encounter
   with the living Jesus Christ' is ‘the path to conversion, communion and
   solidarity'" (no. 7). Such an encounter, so central to all our Jubilee
   Year activities, leads to a daily vision of the risen Lord, present and
   active in the world, especially in the poor, in the stranger, and in
   the migrant and refugee. These immigrants, new to our shores, call us
   out of our unawareness to a conversion of mind and heart through which
   we are able to offer a genuine and suitable welcome, to share together
   as brothers and sisters at the same table, and to work side by side to
   improve the quality of life for society's marginalized members. In so
   doing, we work to bring all the children of God into a fuller
   communion,"the communion willed by God, begun in time and destined for
   completion in the fullness of the Kingdom" (Ecclesia in America, no.
   33).

Introduction: An Immigrant Church, Then and Now

   "For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me
   drink, a stranger and you welcomed me." (Mt 25:35)

   On June 2, 2000, the Jubilee Day for Migrants and Refugees, Pope John
   Paul II looked out over a sunlit crowd of pilgrims gathered in St.
   Peter's Square from all nations: migrants, refugees, seafarers,
   Gypsies,^1 foreign students, circus and carnival workers, airport
   workers, truckers, all varieties of people on the move with their
   bishop promoters, their chaplains and spiritual directors. The pope
   celebrated the Eucharist, which drew that great diversity of people
   into unity in the communion of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He
   reminded them that in the Church they are meant to experience this
   trinitarian communion. In the Church their diversity is to be grounded
   in a profound unity. Through the members of the Church, solitary
   migrations are to end in the embrace of solidarity.

   This jubilee vision of Pope John Paul II is the vision guiding us, the
   bishops of the United States, as we respond to the new immigrants who
   have recently come to our shores.

    Twenty years ago in Beyond the Melting Pot: Cultural Pluralism in the
   United States, we the bishops of the United States noted that cultural
   pluralism was the common heritage of all Americans. As the new
   millennium unfolds, the "new immigration" from all the continents of
   the world calls attention to the reality of the United States as
   largely a "nation of immigrants" and to the diversity of national and
   ethnic origins of all people of this country. In this new context, the
   Catholic community is rapidly re-encountering itself as an "immigrant
   Church," a witness at once to the diversity of people who make up our
   world and to our unity in one humanity, destined to enjoy the fullness
   of God's blessings in Jesus Christ. This unity in diversity was
   celebrated at Encuentro 2000, sponsored as the National Conference of
   Catholic Bishops' principal jubilee celebration, highlighting "many
   faces in God's house."

   A century ago, the Church responded generously to the needs of
   immigrants: building parishes and schools, establishing a vast array of
   charitable institutions, evangelizing newcomers, and being evangelized
   in turn by immigrant Catholics with distinctive traditions of worship
   and often a deep spirituality of their own. Members of the Eastern
   Catholic Churches arrived during the same period. They were not always
   understood by their fellow Catholics, although they were received and
   did develop as members of the Church in America. Despite the attacks of
   "nativists" and the criticisms made by English-speaking Catholics,
   national parishes were established that provided a safe haven where
   newcomers were able to pray and hear the word of God in their own
   languages, begin the education of their children in the language of the
   home, and so adapt to their new society with the security of community
   and faith. The Church embraced these immigrants, supporting them in
   their striving to build a better life and encouraging the efforts of
   many of them to help build a labor movement that could represent them
   in that struggle. And then, as now—despite the predictions of
   critics—immigrants and their children quickly became vital participants
   in American society, acquiring proficiency in English by the second and
   third generations, rising in the educational system, and contributing
   in thousands of ways to the economic growth and social, political, and
   spiritual life of the country.


   Who Are the New Immigrants?
   The "new" immigration to the United States stems from global
   changes—both economic and political—over the past forty years and from
   legal changes starting with the 1965 Immigration Act. The latter
   abolished the quota system that had systematically favored immigrants
   from Western Europe and had largely cut off immigration from Asia,
   Africa, and the Middle East after 1920. Meanwhile war, economic
   distress, the desire to be reunited with families, and the new legal
   opportunities since the 1960s have prompted a diverse immigration from
   Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific Islands, the
   Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union and
   Yugoslavia.


   While the new immigrants include many unskilled workers who perform
   difficult and menial tasks as in the past, the new immigrants also
   include many skilled workers, recruited to fill specialized positions
   as nurses, computer professionals, and scientists. The United States is
   thus beneficiary of the years of education, training, and experience
   that come with these new workers. While we welcome all the new
   immigrants and recognize that our Church, like the United States as a
   whole, has come to depend upon the many talents and profound energy of
   newcomers, we must also remind our government that the emigration of
   talented and trained individuals from the poorer countries represents a
   profound loss to those countries. And we remind heads of government
   around the world that emigration of all kinds—but especially that of
   those fleeing war and persecution, famine and economic distress—is a
   sign of the failure of the whole international community to guarantee
   the security and welfare of all people in their homelands.

   The ultimate resolution of the problems associated with forced
   migration and illegal immigration lies in changing the conditions that
   drive persons from their countries of origin. Accordingly, we urge the
   governments of the world, particularly our own government, to promote a
   just peace in those countries that are at war, to protect human rights
   in those countries that deny them, and to foster the economic
   development of those countries that are unable to provide for their own
   peoples. We also urge the governments of the "receiving" countries to
   welcome these immigrants, to provide for their immediate needs, and to
   enable them to come to self-sufficiency as quickly as possible.


   The Migration for Survival
   We must never forget that many immigrants come to this country in
   desperate circumstances. Some have fled political persecution, war, and
   economic devastation, particularly from Southeast Asia in the 1970s,
   Central America and the Caribbean in the 1980s, and the former
   Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, and Africa in the 1990s. Others
   have wagered on finding a better life in this country in the face of
   economic desperation at home. As Pope John Paul II has noted, "In many
   regions of the world today people live in tragic situations of
   instability and uncertainty. It does not come as a surprise that in
   such contexts the poor and the destitute make plans to escape, to seek
   a new land that can offer them bread, dignity and peace. This is the
   migration of the desperate. . . . Unfortunately, the reality they find
   in host nations is frequently a source of further disappointment"
   (Message on World Migration Day 2000, no. 4).


   Some refugees^2 have enjoyed the sanction and support of the U.S.
   government, while others have been denied attention and systematically
   deported, and some have been subjected to humiliating incarceration
   under deplorable conditions. Increasing numbers of refugees from the
   conflicts of the 1980s have seen their status adjusted to that of
   permanent residency; but disparities in treatment, complicated and
   drawn-out asylum procedures, and long waits for service contribute to
   the already difficult process of adjustment that individuals and
   families in flight have to face. Both individual lay people and church
   agencies have worked alongside secular organizations to correct these
   situations and address the sufferings of those caught up in the complex
   and bureaucratic U.S. immigration system whose policies often lead to
   the fragmenting of families, but more needs to be done.

     Undocumented Immigrants
     One reality remains constant in the American experience of
     immigration: the demand of the U.S. economy for unskilled labor—and
     the corresponding entrance of immigrants seeking work—in
     labor-intensive industries such as agriculture, construction, food
     processing, and services. Undocumented immigrants face special
     hardships in such areas. The Immigration and Naturalization Service
     estimates that three to four million undocumented workers hold jobs
     in this country, many of which are poorly paid, insecure, and
     dangerous. They face discrimination in the workplace and on the
     streets, the constant threat of arrest and deportation, and the fear
     that they or their children will be denied medical care, education,
     or job opportunities. Many have lived in the United States for
     years, establishing roots in their communities, building their
     families, paying taxes, and contributing to the economy. If arrested
     and deported, they leave behind children and sometimes spouses who
     are American citizens. While the changes in the law over the last
     several years have enabled many in this situation to adjust their
     status to that of permanent resident, the 1996 immigration
     legislation made this option more difficult for the vast majority.
     Without condoning undocumented migration, the Church supports the
     human rights of all people and offers them pastoral care, education,
     and social services, no matter what the circumstances of entry into
     this country, and it works for the respect of the human dignity of
     all—especially those who find themselves in desperate circumstances.
     We recognize that nations have the right to control their borders.
     We also recognize and strongly assert that all human persons,
     created as they are in the image of God, possess a fundamental
     dignity that gives rise to a more compelling claim to the conditions
     worthy of human life. Accordingly, the Church also advocates
     legalization opportunities for the maximum number of undocumented
     persons, particularly those who have built equities and otherwise
     contributed to their communities.

   Immigrant Families and Their Communities
   The vast majority of the 600,000 to 900,000 immigrants admitted
   annually to this country enter as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens
   or legal permanent residents, a trend that coincides with the Church's
   teaching supporting family reunification. At the same time, the family
   preference system continues to experience considerable backlogs,
   prolonging the separation of families. The 1996 immigration laws have
   torn apart families that have established themselves in the United
   States over many years, sometimes on the basis of minor criminal
   offences duly punished years ago.

   Over a third of the new immigrants have become naturalized citizens,
   and the longer immigrants remain here the more likely they will become
   citizens; but here, too, the Church views with grave concern recent
   legislation^3 that has withdrawn basic benefits from legal residents
   who are not yet citizens and threatened the ability of many
   hard-working immigrants to remain in this country.

   Immigrants experience the tensions of their new situation much more
   than the society around them does. They have settled in a foreign land
   with laws, customs, and a language that they must master sooner or
   later, often at great personal cost. They struggle to build community
   among themselves in hopes of providing the sense of continuity and
   security they need in order to face the new world they have chosen or
   were forced to accept. They do not want to give up all that they value
   in their own ways of life—nor do they want their children to grow up
   without those traditions. Thus, many households carry on, to one degree
   or another, the cultures of immigrant parents, and today, one in five
   Americans enjoys immediate ties to a heritage beyond our borders.

   These realities ensure that few Americans have not encountered recent
   immigrants to this country in their neighborhoods and workplaces. Long
   Beach, California, is home to more Cambodians than Phnom Phen. Los
   Angeles ranks just behind Mexico City and Guadalajara in the number of
   residents of Mexican origin. Chicago at times has had more persons of
   Polish extraction than Warsaw. At the same time, rural towns and small
   cities throughout the country have begun to feel a presence of
   immigrants in their communities not seen since the great wave of
   immigration at the end of the nineteenth century.


   The New Immigration and the Church
   Many of the new immigrants are Catholics. Probably more than 80 percent
   of Hispanic immigrants were raised in the Catholic faith. By some
   estimates, Hispanic Catholics—including the United States' large Puerto
   Rican and Mexican American populations^4—could make up the majority of
   U.S. Catholics within the next twenty years. But other immigrant
   populations also include large numbers of Catholics. Filipinos, who
   represent almost 5 percent of the immigrant population, are
   overwhelmingly Catholic. Some 350,000 of the 1.4 million Vietnamese
   immigrants in this country are Catholic. These Catholics are joined by
   thousands of Eastern Catholics coming from the former Soviet Union, the
   Middle East, and India. A smaller but still significant number of the
   Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Laotian, Sri Lankan, Indonesian, Tongan,
   Samoan, and Asian Indian immigrants are also Catholic. Among the
   increasing numbers of immigrants from Africa, many are Catholics,
   raised in the vibrant Catholic culture of the Church's fastest growing
   region.

   Throughout the country, the liturgy and church decor increasingly
   reflect the cultural gifts of the new immigrants, with their own images
   of Mary and the saints, their songs, and their distinctive celebrations
   taking their place alongside those of older generations of immigrants.
   And immigrant communities provide a growing percentage of the vocations
   to the priesthood and religious life as well as lay leadership at the
   service of the Church in the United States today. The profile provided
   regarding the new immigrants who are Catholic should not minimize the
   Church's overwhelming concern for all new arrivals, regardless of their
   religious tradition or lack of one.



The Calling of the Church


   In this context of opportunity and challenge that is the new
   immigration, we bishops of the United States reaffirm the commitment of
   the Church, in the words of Pope John Paul II, to work "so that every
   person's dignity is respected, the immigrant is welcomed as a brother
   or sister, and all humanity forms a united family which knows how to
   appreciate with discernment the different cultures which comprise it"
   (Message for World Migration Day 2000, no. 5). We call upon all people
   of good will, but Catholics especially, to welcome the newcomers in
   their neighborhoods and schools, in their places of work and worship,
   with heartfelt hospitality, openness, and eagerness both to help and to
   learn from our brothers and sisters, of whatever race, religion,
   ethnicity, or background.

   A Tradition of Welcome and Pastoral Concern
   This call is based on the rich heritage of Scripture and the Church's
   teaching. The patriarchs themselves were nomads. Settled by the hand of
   God in the time of Abraham, they soon migrated to Egypt, where they
   suffered oppression and were delivered once again by God's hand. From
   this experience comes a deep appreciation for the plight of the
   migrant, underlined in the words of Scripture: "You shall not oppress
   an alien; you well know how it feels to be an alien, since you were
   once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt" (Ex 23:9). "You shall
   treat the stranger who resides with you no differently than the natives
   born among you, have the same love for him as for yourself; for you too
   were once strangers in the land of Egypt" (Lv 19:33-34). The Torah made
   special provisions for immigrants with the reminder that "you too were
   once slaves in Egypt" (Dt 16:9-12): "At the end of every third year you
   shall bring out all the tithes of your produce for that year and
   deposit them in community stores, that the Levite who has no share in
   the heritage with you, and also the alien, the orphan and the widow who
   belong to your community, may come and eat their fill; so that the
   Lord, your God, may bless you in all that you undertake" (Dt 14:28-29).

   Indeed, the experience of exile, oppression, and deliverance to the
   Promised Land is the central act of the drama of salvation for Judaism.
   In honor of God's deliverance of his people, Israel was enjoined to
   show justice towards all: "For the Lord, your God, is the God of gods,
   the Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who has no
   favorites, accepts no bribes; who executes justice for the orphan and
   the widow, and befriends the alien, feeding and clothing him. So you
   too must befriend the alien, for you were once aliens yourselves in the
   land of Egypt" (Dt 10:17-19). Jesus echoes this tradition when he
   proclaims prophetically, "For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was
   thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me" (Mt
   25:35).

   The Church has remained faithful to this call to care for migrants of
   all kinds and has responded accordingly over the centuries. The
   apostolic constitution Exsul Familia, promulgated by Pope Pius XII in
   1952, takes its name from its evocation of the "émigré Holy Family of
   Nazareth, fleeing into Egypt," to which the pope pointed as "the
   archetype of every refugee family." Pope Pius XII recalls a long
   tradition of papal solicitude for immigrants and refugees, noting the
   hospitality to strangers and refugees traditionally provided by the
   Holy See and recalling the words of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215:
   "We find in most countries, cities and dioceses people of diverse
   languages who, though bound by one Faith, have varied rites and
   customs. Therefore we strictly enjoin that the Bishops of these cities
   or dioceses provide the proper men, who will celebrate the Liturgical
   Functions according to their rites and languages." The pope cites with
   pride, as one proof of the Church's constant solicitude in this
   respect, the provisions for the establishment of "national parishes" in
   the United States in the nineteenth century to accommodate the
   immigrants of that era.

   The Second Vatican Council likewise called on the national bishops'
   conferences to pay special attention to those who "are not adequately
   cared for by the ordinary pastoral ministry of the parochial clergy or
   are entirely deprived of it," including "the many migrants, exiles and
   refugees," and to devise solutions for them (Christus Dominus, no. 18),
   a call endorsed by Pope Paul VI in approving a revision of church norms
   regarding pastoral care for immigrants. His Instruction on the Pastoral
   Care of People Who Migrate affirmed that "migrating people carry with
   them their own mentality, their own language, their own culture, and
   their own religion. All of these things are parts of a certain
   spiritual heritage of opinions, traditions and culture which will
   perdure outside the homeland. Let it be prized highly everywhere" (no.
   11).

    These words should apply with special force to members of the numerous
   Eastern Catholic Churches, who preserve ancient traditions of worship
   and practice reaching back to the days of the apostles. In full
   communion with the Catholic Church, they are the bearers of the
   authentic teachings of the Church, each according to their own
   traditions. Because of political upheaval, war, and religious
   persecution, the twentieth century saw an unprecedented emigration—one
   that continues today—of Eastern Catholics who are a minority in their
   countries of origin and who must struggle to maintain their faith and
   their traditions in the United States in the context of the predominant
   Latin Church.

   Pope John Paul II urges in his apostolic letter Orientale Lumen that a
   "conversion is . . . required of the Latin Church, that she may respect
   and fully appreciate the dignity of Eastern Christians, and accept
   gratefully the spiritual treasures of which the Eastern Catholic
   Churches are the bearers, to the benefit of the entire catholic
   Communion" (no. 21).

   The immigrants among us thus bring a richness that we are bound to
   embrace, for their sake and for our own. As Pope Paul VI noted, in
   words recently recalled by Pope John Paul II, "The Church can regard no
   one as excluded from its motherly embrace, no one as outside the scope
   of its motherly care. It has no enemies except those who wish to make
   themselves such. Its catholicity is no idle boast. It was not for
   nothing that it received its mission to foster love, unity and peace
   among men" (Ecclesiam Suam, no. 94). The way to achieve this mission
   was presented on January 22, 1999, when Pope John Paul II stood beneath
   the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City and delivered to the
   whole Church the post-synodal apostolic exhortation Ecclesia in
   America—On the Encounter with the Living Jesus Christ: The Way to
   Conversion, Communion and Solidarity in America. This is the way we
   will follow in this document.

A Call to Conversion

   Though we celebrate the diversity within our communities, we bishops
   must also confess that today, as in the past, the treatment of the
   immigrant too often reflects failures of understanding and sinful
   patterns of chauvinism, prejudice, and discrimination that deny the
   unity of the human family, of which the one baptism is our enduring
   sign. Such patterns, in the words of Pope John Paul II, "show the
   urgent need for a transformation of structures and a change of
   mentality, which is what the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000 asks of
   Christians and every person of good will" (Message for World Migration
   Day 2000, no. 1). For Catholics especially, a recognition of failures
   in the face of the opportunities and challenges of the new immigration
   should serve as a call to a renewal of baptismal vows, through
   repentance and a sharing in the mercy of the one Lord who would gather
   all to himself in the unity of the children of God.

   We bishops must confess, as well, that recent immigrants have not
   always encountered welcome in the Church. Today immigrants of all sorts
   too often face prejudice within the Church. At times their legitimate
   desire to worship in their own language, according to their own
   traditions, has not been satisfied. Some have been turned away by
   pastors or find their petition for a Mass in their own language and a
   share in parish facilities opposed by members of the parish community.
   For those who live far from concentrated populations of people who
   share their heritage, there is often no alternative but to struggle
   through the English Mass while the deepest expressions of their spirit
   cry out silently in another language. Where the Church has not been
   welcoming, many have turned to other sources of community and religious
   fulfillment, but at the expense of abandoning the riches of their
   Catholic faith and native traditions.

   Forgetful of Our Heritage
   Perhaps the greatest obstacle to welcoming the stranger is that many
   Americans have forgotten their immigrant past. "Nativism" assumes that
   there is just one image of a "real American" and that immigrants either
   cannot live up to it or willfully refuse to do so. Originally directed
   against Catholics of all sorts, today such nativism can be seen in a
   campaign against "multiculturalism" in all its forms, on the premise
   that reverence for distinctive traditions and histories undermines the
   unity of American society. Like the Catholic "Americanizers" of the
   nineteenth century, who opposed the establishment of national parishes,
   the critics of multiculturalism today want immigrants and other
   distinctive groups to shed their languages, customs, and identities as
   quickly as possible, to become Americans "just like the rest of us."
   But "the rest of us" are, in fact, a culturally plural
   society—Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Muslims; believers and
   non-believers; Southerners and Northerners; Irish, Italian, and
   Mexican—proud of our heritages and proud to be Americans, all at once.

   A kind of nativism appears in the Church itself when established
   members insist that there is just one way to worship, one set of
   familiar hymns, one small handful of familiar devotions, one way to
   organize a parish community, one language for all—and that immigrants
   must adapt to that way of doing things. In doing so, such nativists
   forget not only that their ancestors spoke different languages and
   worshiped in different ways not long ago, but that their devotions and
   familiar saints, even their patterns of church organization, sprang
   from encounters between differing traditions within the Church.

   Competition for Resources
   Competition for resources and recognition among the ethnic groups of
   the parish often centers on specifics such as Mass times, the use of
   facilities, and the attention of priests; but such conflicts can
   reflect vague fears that one group will somehow displace a
   long-established one. Established parishioners, used to thinking of
   their parish practices and religious traditions as the norm, may cling
   to their control over the parish council or "prime" Sunday Mass times.
   They may find themselves increasingly a minority and may react with
   fear to protect the parish where they were raised and where they saw
   their children baptized and educated in the faith. African American
   Catholics, who have their own history of having been excluded and
   discriminated against in the larger Church, as in society in general,
   now face newcomers in many of their parishes, newcomers who threaten
   their hold on the few institutions where they have come to feel at
   home. In some cases, multiple immigrant groups compete with one another
   within a single parish. In other cases, immigrant clergy struggle with
   their bishop or pastor for control over the finances of an immigrant
   group or for final authority over the congregation. While such
   competition can be destructive of community life, the issues involved
   are often real, and they require wisdom, much charity, and careful
   mediation to reach solutions that respect the legitimate concerns of
   all sides.

   Cultural Fears
   The fears associated with encounters between groups are often difficult
   to overcome precisely because they are unacknowledged or unclear. Some
   are afraid because they do not know how to behave with others of a
   different culture. Others—in ignorance, relying on stereotypes—are
   convinced that those who are different are also somehow inferior: less
   educated, "dirty," or dangerous. Negative images and derogatory jokes
   and remarks readily merge with racism, America's "original sin,"
   reinforcing the fear of the unknown in many people's minds by creating
   stereotypes about people whose facial features or skin color identify
   them as Asian, Arab, African, or Mexican. In some instances, racism has
   been so deeply ingrained that an institutional racism prevails. Racist
   attitudes can linger in subtle ways, even when people get to know one
   another in parish activities, unless we vigorously educate ourselves
   about our neighbors, learn to appreciate their heritages, encounter
   their own images of us, and strive to work with them on behalf of
   common causes.

   Some of our fears are tied to what we see as defense of our own culture
   or way of life. Many people cling—rightfully so—to their distinctive
   culture. They fear the loss of their own familiar ways of doing things
   as they encounter new images and practices of community life and
   worship that are foreign to them. Immigrants themselves often fear
   other groups and worry that their children will lose the values of the
   homeland, come to show disrespect towards their parents and elders, and
   exchange their own culture for the consumer values of the surrounding
   society. Such concerns are well founded, and they compound the
   difficulties of adaptation to a new setting as both host and immigrant
   react, each against the other, in fear of change.

   Change, however, is inevitable as immigrants set down roots in this
   country, enriching American culture while adopting aspects of it
   themselves. Indeed, it would be a mistake to regard any culture as
   fixed and immutable. All cultures are in constant processes of change
   as their members seek new ways to address individual and group needs
   and as they encounter new situations and other cultures. Indeed, no
   culture is either permanent or perfect. All constantly need to be
   evangelized and uplifted by the good news of Jesus Christ. The
   encounter between cultures that is an everyday affair in the
   incorporation of immigrants into the Church and the communities of the
   United States should provoke not only adaptation on both sides but a
   critical discernment of the strengths and failings of each culture in
   the light of the Gospel.

   Institutional Obstacles
   Institutional inadequacies have also impeded the full-fledged welcome
   and communion to which the Church is called. Parish and diocesan
   structures have not always been flexible enough to accommodate sudden
   influxes of new groups. Parishes have found themselves serving faith
   communities that draw members from far outside parish boundaries,
   raising questions about the sources and limits of parish resources. And
   regrettably, some parishes have found that their parishioners have
   imbibed the post-1960s societal attitude of exclusion of new
   immigrants. In many cases, immigrant Catholics have been attracted to
   evangelical and Pentecostal churches, leaving behind their Catholic
   faith.

   Many pastors struggle to accommodate separate worship communities who
   celebrate their faith in their native tongues within the same parish.
   Pastors strive to meet the needs of multiple culturally diverse groups
   who are too small to support their own Eucharist and specialized
   programs. Similarly, pastors who wish to serve whoever approaches the
   altar may lack the experience or the models to know how to reach out to
   newcomers who are not Catholic or whose Catholicism has not included a
   regular liturgical life or whose faith is tied more closely to home and
   family than to the parish community.

   Immigrant communities must find priests willing and able to minister in
   their language and a place to gather for worship and community
   activities. They are often at a loss as to how to supply themselves
   with liturgical texts and educational materials and how to develop a
   sense of communion with a diocese whose language is not their own. They
   struggle to balance the competing demands of U.S. schools and the
   larger culture on their youth with their own desires to benefit their
   children with traditional values and culture. Immigrant priests may
   find themselves jealous of their own autonomy and better able to relate
   to their own priests' associations and dioceses of origin than to the
   priests and diocese of their U.S. home, where they may feel a lack of
   welcome.

   The tensions and debates occasioned by such concerns can sometimes lead
   to greater understanding within the Church. But they can also lead, in
   the extreme, to painful schisms and the alienation of the faithful from
   the Church. Taken together—and despite the efforts of many
   dioceses—such tensions make clear that the Church has not adequately
   addressed the host of questions that surround pastoral ministry to the
   new immigrants. In this and the other respects mentioned above, the
   Church of the twenty-first century requires a profound conversion in
   spirit and in its institutions to reflect its own cultural pluralism,
   to address the needs of the whole Catholic community, and to further a
   genuine communion and solidarity among the diverse members of the Body
   of Christ.

   This debate on the effective and adequate response of current church
   institutions to the new immigrant reality echoes the discussion in the
   Synod of America and Ecclesia in America on the effectiveness of parish
   structures:

     Because of the particular problems they present, special attention
     needs to be given to parishes in large urban areas, where the
     difficulties are such that normal parish structures are inadequate
     and the opportunities for the apostolate are significantly reduced.
     The institution of the parish, however, retains its importance and
     needs to be preserved. For this, there is a need "to keep looking
     for ways in which the parish and its pastoral structures can be more
     in effective in urban areas." (no. 41)


A Call to Communion


   As Catholics we are called to take concrete measures to overcome the
   misunderstanding, ignorance, competition, and fear that stand in the
   way of genuinely welcoming the stranger in our midst and enjoying the
   communion that is our destiny as Children of God. We commit ourselves,
   accordingly, to working to strengthen understanding among the many
   cultures that share in our Catholic faith, to promoting intercultural
   communication among our people, and to seeing that those in ministry to
   our communities gain the language and cultural skills necessary to
   minister to the immigrants in our midst.

   Coming to Understand Others as the First Form of Hospitality
   Time and time again, Pope John Paul II has echoed the teachings of his
   predecessors and of the Second Vatican Council that "it is one of the
   properties of the human person that he can achieve true and full
   humanity only by means of culture" (Gaudium et Spes, no. 53) and that
   to take away a person's culture is therefore to damage human dignity
   grievously. Communion does not abolish differences but brings together
   one family, diverse and united in the one Lord. Pope Paul VI urged that
   "it must be avoided that these diversities and adaptations in
   accordance with the various ethnical groups, even though legitimate,
   result in harm to that unity to which all are called in the Church"
   (Pastoralis Migratorum Cura). Thus, the Church's norms for the pastoral
   care of immigrants attempt to balance the legitimate rights of
   immigrants with their duty to look to the common good of both their
   communities of origin and their host community (Instruction on the
   Pastoral Care of People Who Migrate, nos. 5-11).

   The Church embraces the rich cultural pluralism of this immigrant
   nation—what some call its "multicultural" reality.^5 Pope John Paul II
   insists that "the immigrant members of the Church, while freely
   exercising their rights and duties and being in full ecclesial
   communion in the particular churches, feeling themselves Christians and
   brothers towards all, must be able to remain completely themselves as
   far as language, culture, liturgy and spirituality, and particular
   traditions are concerned" (Address for World Migrants' Day, July 16,
   1985). Indeed, the pope warns repeatedly against attempting to rush a
   process of assimilation or cultural adaptation in the name of unity,
   because the goal is the mutual enrichment of peoples, not their
   assimilation to one way of being human. Thus the pope reached out to
   refugees in the camp at Phanat Nikon, Thailand, in November 1984,
   saying, "My heart is with you. Have faith in yourselves. Don't forget
   your identity as a free people with your own legitimate place in this
   world. Don't lose your distinctive personality as a people! Remain
   firmly rooted in your respective cultures. The world needs to learn
   more from you and to join in appreciation of your uniqueness."

   The pope teaches that immigrants must guard their cultures for the
   enrichment of the world. But the cultures of immigrants will only be
   able to enrich this country when all Americans—recent immigrants and
   those long settled in this country—open their hearts and minds to their
   neighbors and come to appreciate the diverse cultures that make up this
   society. Knowledge of cultures cannot just come from books, but must
   come from the concrete efforts of individuals to get to know their
   neighbors, in all their diversity.

   The welcome and hospitality that we ask our parishes to extend to
   newcomers must include active efforts on the part of the pastor and
   parish staff, individuals and families, parish councils, liturgy
   committees, social concern entities, youth groups, and other parish
   organizations to undertake the special effort necessary to learn about
   the cultures in their midst and to exchange visits with worship
   communities and parishes where different cultural groups make their
   homes. Special events such as international dinners, common social
   events, and multicultural parish feasts can help to introduce the
   various members of the parish to other cultures and can lead to greater
   exchanges between groups. The parish is encouraged to sponsor forums in
   which members of different cultures can openly share their unique
   backgrounds and identify areas of unity.

   The eucharistic celebration is central to church life and to our
   communion as Catholics with one another in the one Lord. Whenever the
   diverse cultures of parish and diocese are able to share the Eucharist
   in special celebrations that reflect the cultural riches of the
   participants, the Church demonstrates in the sacrament of our unity the
   multicultural face of the Church, proclaiming "with joy and firm faith
   that God is communion, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, unity in
   distinction, and that he calls all people to share in that same
   Trinitarian communion" (Ecclesia in America, no. 34).

   Intercultural Communication
   Efforts to learn and worship together may come to nothing at all—or
   even reinforce prejudices—unless they are carried out with a spirit of
   openness and charity. Not everything in one culture will meet with the
   approval of another. There may be disagreements about child-rearing
   practices, the place of women in the liturgy, styles of preaching, or
   suitable expressions of piety. Such differences are inevitable even
   within one culture. But in cross-cultural encounters, disagreements
   must be informed by understanding the roots of people's attitudes and
   practices and with respect for their right to find their own way within
   the one Gospel. Understanding will come with a growing knowledge of the
   history, values, and experiences of others. Respect must be born of
   charity and faith in the ultimate unity in Christ of all humanity.

   Intercultural communication—sustained efforts, carried out by people of
   diverse cultures, to appreciate their differences, work out conflicts,
   and build on commonalities—will thus be an important component of
   coming to know and respect the diverse cultures that make up today's
   Church. The dominant culture in the United States stresses the
   individual and his or her feelings and decisions. In less
   individualistic cultures, individuals may feel hesitant to express
   their own opinions openly, even in a friendly setting, without
   reinforcement from the group. Among immigrants of the same group, too,
   divisions along lines of social class or educational background can
   erect barriers to understanding, with some members adapting to the
   procedures and practices of parish life more readily than others.
   Often, culturally sensitive intermediaries are needed to facilitate
   exchanges, mediate conflicts, and promote genuine participation by all.

   Integration will be facilitated when all parties maintain an open
   spirit. Integration cannot be forced, and those who host newcomers must
   be especially aware of the vulnerabilities of immigrants and the
   impulse many immigrants feel to withdraw from interaction. Pastors and
   lay leaders who are aware of these dynamics of adaptation and
   communication among cultures will lead the way in facilitating the
   full, equal incorporation of all members of the community into the life
   of the Church.

   Languages for Ministry
   Special efforts to acquire the languages of the new immigrants by all
   church ministers constitute an essential, concrete step towards a full
   and effective welcome. In some cases, immigrant groups have brought
   with them significant numbers of priests and religious. This is true of
   the Vietnamese community, which has continued to produce vocations in
   large numbers in this country. In other cases, the home country's
   Church is sufficiently strong to send priests and religious to the
   United States to minister to immigrant communities from that country,
   as was the case in earlier waves of migration to this country. In many
   cases today, however, there are many immigrants but few priests, and
   dioceses must make special provisions to find or train priests,
   religious, and lay people capable of ministering to the newcomers in
   their own languages and cultures. Missionary orders have contributed
   magnificently to filling this need. In some dioceses, every seminarian
   is required to master a language other than English relevant to
   ministry to local immigrant communities. This practice should be
   encouraged throughout the United States. Priests, seminarians,
   religious, and lay ministers should all be encouraged to learn a
   language and acquire cultural knowledge relevant to their ministry.^6
   Study abroad is generally the best way to do this, and it should be
   widely encouraged.

   Especially in the case of some of the smaller immigrant groups, priests
   may have only a rudimentary knowledge of the language of the group they
   serve. Then they must depend upon religious, lay leaders, deacons, and
   trained catechists to ensure an effective ministry. And even where
   priests with the necessary language skills are available, it is
   important that other members of the larger community acquire the
   ability to communicate with immigrants in their own languages as part
   of a wider effort to develop more inclusive relations at the parish and
   diocesan levels, carry on the necessary work of evangelization, and
   promote diocesan programs capable of genuinely uniting diverse
   communities. The clergy and lay leaders should acquire a proficiency in
   English as quickly as possible and continue to improve their public
   speaking skills in English so as to further the communion of their
   communities with the wider Church in the United States. Parishes should
   provide opportunities for immigrants, including the elderly, to acquire
   proficiency in the English language.

   Ministry in a Multicultural Church
   Language acquisition on behalf of intercultural communication and
   effective ministry is just one practical step towards the fuller
   incorporation of the new immigrants into our communities. The Church as
   an institution needs to undertake other practical steps at national,
   diocesan, and parish levels.

     National or Regional Level
     At the national or regional level, efforts must be made to provide
     liturgical and catechetical materials for communities who do not
     have ready access to such materials in their language. Most dioceses
     lack the resources to provide such materials for more than one or
     two groups. Similarly, diocesan seminaries and lay ministry training
     programs are often ill-equipped to provide priests, religious, and
     lay leaders with the full range of linguistic, cultural, and
     intercultural communication training necessary to serve even local
     needs.

     Efforts to redress these problems could be furthered by the creation
     of regional pastoral centers, serving the needs of one or several
     immigrant ethnic communities and financed by the dioceses they
     serve. Such centers could encourage theological reflection based on
     the traditions and experience of the various national churches
     represented in our immigrant communities. They could provide the
     translation services mentioned above and serve as a source for
     liturgical and catechetical materials for the communities they
     represent, as well as develop training materials for pastors,
     religious, and lay leaders in these communities. And they could
     offer training for all those involved in ministry to specific groups
     within the dioceses of their regions, extending the range of
     possibilities of language education, intercultural communication
     training, and education for ministry in a multicultural Church more
     generally.

     Diocesan Level
     Dioceses are the best equipped to address the multiple needs of the
     contemporary Church at the local level. The bishop as pastor of a
     diverse people has the care for all that concerns their life
     together. Thus, in developing diocesan policies and programs
     responsive to the reality of today's immigrant Church, bishops must
     take care to both respect the dignity of the diverse communities of
     the diocese and draw them to unity in the one Church, striking that
     balance between the legitimate rights of immigrants to worship
     according to their own traditions and the concern for the common
     life of the Church in the United States. Diocesan authorities must
     decide when and how to honor the desire of immigrant groups for
     their own chapel, mission, or personal parish; how to foster a
     spirit of openness and welcome towards immigrant communities within
     parishes; how to promote the effective evangelization of all members
     of the local church and of those outside the Church; and how to
     bring together peoples of all the diverse cultures of the Church
     into one community.

     We bishops commit ourselves with renewed energy to display a spirit
     of welcome, and we encourage all those involved in ministry to share
     in that spirit. We will look to the successful models of the past,
     such as the national parish, or contemporary practices in other
     dioceses, and adapt them to the needs and circumstances of our own
     dioceses. In each of our dioceses we will build up programs of
     ministry to immigrants and support them with new resources to the
     extent possible, in recognition of the growing contributions of our
     immigrant communities to the larger Church, and we will insist that
     pastors lend their support. Our diocesan seminaries must prepare
     seminarians for ministry to the Church of the twenty-first century.
     At the same time, we will devote resources to developing programs of
     cultural understanding and intercultural communication for religious
     and lay ministers. We bishops have a special responsibility to
     address questions of social justice for migrants of all sorts,
     participating in national and local efforts to combat discrimination
     and ensure equitable treatment under the law to all.

     In the past, personal parishes were established successfully in some
     places to accommodate the needs and desires of strong, local
     immigrant communities. At the same time, not all groups have had the
     financial resources or numbers to sustain a parish of their own.
     Dioceses may need to develop guidelines to help parishes or
     deaneries respond to smaller or more dispersed groups so that they
     sense that they are welcome and have facilities appropriate to their
     needs.

     Most dioceses have already provided modest resources to offices of
     ethnic ministry. The more these offices can be led by members of the
     communities being served, the better. In some cases, the bishop has
     appointed a vicar in charge of ministry to larger or more dispersed
     groups. In a few dioceses, Hispanic ministry in particular has been
     integrated into all of the offices of the diocese, providing
     constant feedback on how to address the needs of the Hispanic
     community within the various diocesan programs. In many dioceses,
     offices of ethnic ministry are able to ensure that parish positions
     are filled so as to serve the immigrant communities within the
     diocese. And many dioceses have designed diocesan-wide events to
     bring together the various cultures of the Catholic community. All
     of these efforts need to be studied and strengthened as the Church
     in the United States strives to celebrate the many gifts that
     immigrant communities bring to the Church in America.

     Parish Level
     Immigrants will experience the Church's welcome most personally at
     the level of the parish. Pastors and parish staff, accordingly, must
     be filled with a spirit of welcome, responding to a new and perhaps
     little-understood culture. They will be able to do so precisely to
     the extent that they have received the support of the diocese and
     the training that should go with it. A pastor with an open and
     welcoming spirit who insists that the whole parish participate in
     such a spirit can make a tremendous difference in relations among
     different groups. Pastors need to know about effective models for
     accommodating multiple cultural groups within a single parish
     structure. At the same time, the effort to mediate competing demands
     for facilities and lingering rivalries among groups requires
     sensitivity to the needs and styles of both cultures, as well as
     patience, charity, and communications skills. Pastors should make
     every effort to assist and encourage Eastern Catholics to find
     parishes that offer pastoral care according to their own traditions
     and rites. In the past immigrants belonging to Eastern Catholic
     churches were lost to those churches because of the lack of Eastern
     Catholic clergy, churches, and services. Sometimes they were joined
     to the Latin church, regrettably because of social and demographic
     pressures. Membership in a particular church of the immigrant (e.g.,
     Eastern Catholic Church) must be respected.

     Reaching out to immigrants who are not Catholics or who, though
     Catholic, have not yet participated fully in the life of the parish
     requires language and cultural skills, as well as an evangelical
     zeal that will need to be developed among more pastors, associates,
     religious, and lay people through outreach committees or census
     programs. Lay people, especially those who share language and
     cultural background with the immigrant group, can be invaluable
     bridges in efforts to incorporate immigrant communities into the
     life of the parish and reach out to non-believers among the new
     immigrants. In many of the countries from which the new immigrants
     come, it was the lay catechist who led people to conversion or a
     deeper appreciation of the faith. Lay catechists were the leaders
     and evangelizers of their people. Their ministry needs to be
     reaffirmed and strengthened in the new context.

     Catholic Charities offers comprehensive services in most dioceses.
     Pastors can look to Catholic Charities for help in their response to
     new immigrants. Social service, legal assistance, and adult
     education programs—including English as a second language,
     parenting, job training programs, and citizenship classes—can serve
     as valuable outreach to newcomers. The parish can also provide
     immigrants with forums for addressing social, emotional, and
     economic needs. Models and methods of a genuinely evangelical parish
     life need to be developed and disseminated so that pastors and lay
     leaders may choose among those best adapted to providing effective
     outreach to newcomers. In some cases, individual pastors or
     consortia of parishes, sometimes in conjunction with congregations
     of other faiths or secular organizations, can create immigration and
     social service agencies to serve particular neighborhoods.

     At the same time, parishes can become sites for dialogue and
     cooperation, not only with the Protestant denominations that share
     our common Christian faith, but also with Buddhists, Hindus,
     Muslims, Jews, and others. Despite differences, all share common
     goals of providing for the religious and material needs of immigrant
     communities, and all have much to gain by working together.

     Today's immigrants bring a vast richness of gifts, from new
     spiritual movements to a renewal of devotion to Mary in the great
     variety of national devotions, such as that to Our Lady of
     Guadalupe. In many dioceses, a renewal of vocations to the
     priesthood and religious life is one evident fruit of the new
     immigration, while lay participation in ministry has blossomed in
     many ethnic ministries.

     The Special Needs of Youth
     Of special concern are the youth of immigrant communities. Some are
     themselves immigrants, who despite a facility for acquiring English
     may feel especially torn between their original culture and that of
     their new home—fully at home in neither one culture nor the other.
     Others were born in this country, and though their first language
     may have been that of their parents, they quickly acquire the
     fluency of a native not only in the English language but in the
     prevailing culture in their schools and neighborhoods. In either
     case, young people may find themselves frequently in conflict with
     their parents and elders over ways of behaving and speaking, values,
     and beliefs, as they become "American" while living within an
     immigrant household and community that retain the country of
     origin's culture. Such conflicts are painful for both sides, and one
     or the other may call upon the Church to defend its particular
     claims and values. Young people can also experience conflict with
     their peers who—because of insecurity or insensitivity—cause
     unnecessary division.

     The Church recognizes the centrality of the family in the upbringing
     of  the young and cherishes the great value that many immigrant
     cultures place upon the family. At the same time, it also has a duty
     to provide for the young as they struggle for their own identity and
     their own adaptation within the larger culture. Recreational,
     educational, and spiritual programs for youth can provide
     opportunities for helping them to understand and accommodate the
     claims of their parents while accepting what is wholesome in the
     culture around them. These programs can also help young people live
     in harmony with their peers. Everyday pastoral care and special
     programs for parents can help them understand and accept the
     struggles of their children, even as they reinforce the confidence
     that their children have already assimilated much of what they have
     to teach them despite the dissensions of the moment. Religious
     education programs can play a special role here in attempting to
     bridge the gap between cultures within the context of the one faith
     and to help the young deal positively with the tensions and
     difficulties they face.

     In some instances, families are drawn to the parish precisely to
     take advantage of the school. Their immersion in their children's
     education puts them into regular contact with parish personnel and
     members of other cultural groups. In other cases, immigrants have
     had no experience of Catholic schools in their country of origin and
     require the encouragement (and often financial aid) of the parish to
     take advantage of this opportunity. Catholic schools can provide the
     children of immigrants with opportunities to adapt to American
     culture in a context permeated by the faith and in an atmosphere of
     hospitality to all cultures, and they can do much to promote
     cultural understanding and respect among parents and students alike.
     Catholic schools can also be powerful instruments of evangelization
     for immigrant communities who, though outside the Church, find in
     the schools a welcoming and supportive environment for the education
     of their children. But for a great many immigrants, none of this can
     be accomplished unless Catholic schools are made affordable for the
     poorer members of the community, a goal to which the diocese may
     have to contribute through sister-parish arrangements or outright
     grants of diocesan funds.

The Call to Solidarity

   The Gospel calls us to solidarity with those who are suffering,
   vulnerable, and in need. In this spirit we recall the words of Pope
   John Paul II, who proclaimed, "The Church hears the suffering cry of
   all who are uprooted from their own land, of families forcefully
   separated, of those who, in the rapid changes of our day, are unable to
   find a stable home anywhere. She senses the anguish of those without
   rights, without any security, at the mercy of every kind of
   exploitation, and she supports them in their unhappiness" (Message for
   World Migration Day 2000, no. 6). Among today's immigrants, those who
   have fled war, famine, civil unrest, and economic desperation deserve
   our special understanding and support; but seafarers, those in the
   aviation world, and migrant workers, too, suffer uprootedness,
   discrimination, and injustice, along with all people on the move:
   circus and carnival workers, truckers, tourists, pilgrims, Gypsies, and
   Irish travelers.
   In an age of economic globalization, a special concern of a culture of
   solidarity must be the migrant worker, both rural and urban. These
   laborers are vital to our agricultural, construction, service, and
   tourist industries. From the time they leave their homes to the time
   they arrive at their place of work, these migrant workers—forced to
   search for a basic livelihood for their families—face hazardous border
   crossings. (In the  past five years, more than 500 have died at the
   U.S.–Mexico border because of increased border enforcement.) They are
   vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in transit, in border regions, and
   in the workplace. We bishops pledge ourselves, in the spirit of
   Ecclesia in America, to work in solidarity with the bishops of the
   migrants' countries of origin to provide for the safety, the basic
   needs, the human rights, and the effective pastoral care of these
   migrant workers. One of the propositions of the Synod of America
   asserts, "The Church in America must be a vigilant advocate, defending
   against any unjust restriction the natural right of individual persons
   to move freely within their own nation and from one nation to another.
   Attention must be called to the rights of migrants and their families
   and to respect for their human dignity, even in cases of non-legal
   immigration" (Ecclesia in America, no. 65).
   Solidarity with migrants and refugees will take many forms, from
   participating in efforts to ensure that the U.S. government respect the
   basic human rights of all immigrants, to providing direct assistance to
   immigrants through diocesan and parish programs. Particularly
   vulnerable are the immigrant elderly who often find themselves isolated
   in their new country, lacking in language skills and in the family and
   community support system that they enjoyed in their country of origin.
     Community organizing efforts can also be important vehicles for
   addressing the needs of immigrant communities and incorporating
   immigrants into civic life. Such efforts can provide the basis for
   achieving improved housing conditions, a living wage, better medical
   attention, and enhanced educational opportunities for all, and for
   empowering local communities. The United States Catholic Conference
   supports many such efforts through the Catholic Campaign for Human
   Development. The local church's participation in such efforts is
   important, both for the direct good that community organizing can do
   for individuals and groups and as part of a broader evangelization that
   proclaims God's care for all his children and the Church's special
   responsibility for the poor, the persecuted, and the stranger.
   The call to solidarity is also a call to promote the effective
   recognition of the rights of immigrants and to overcome all
   discrimination based on race, culture, or religion. "It means bearing
   witness to a fraternal life based on the Gospel, which respects
   cultural differences and is open to sincere and trustful dialogue"
   (Pope Paul VI, Octogesima Adveniens, no. 17). Especially since World
   War II, the Church has devoted special efforts on behalf of the human
   rights of migrants and refugees throughout the world, and in the United
   States in particular. At the national level the U.S. bishops' Office of
   Migration and Refugee Services has addressed these issues through
   participation in public policy debates, special programs for refugees,
   and aid to dioceses. Diocesan officials and parish leaders often
   participate as well in city- or region-wide bodies aimed at gaining
   recognition for immigrants in local affairs and combating
   discrimination.
   We Catholic bishops commit ourselves to continue to work at the
   national level to promote recognition of the human rights of all,
   regardless of their immigration status, and to advance fair and
   equitable legislation for refugees and prospective immigrants. Present
   efforts need to be strengthened and supported with new initiatives,
   both at the local level and at the national level as U.S. immigration
   law and practice change in the face of changing political pressures and
   social realities. In particular, Catholic lay people, diocesan
   officials, and bishops should continue to work together with community
   organizations, labor unions, and other religious bodies on behalf of
   the rights of immigrants in the workplace, schools, public services,
   our legal system, and all levels of government. The Catholic Church in
   the United States through the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
   many of the state Catholic conferences, individual bishops, and other
   Catholic organizations have been meaningfully involved in social
   advocacy in behalf of migrant workers and other immigrants. We
   encourage others to place public social policies that impact this
   special population a higher priority.

Conclusion: A Call to a New Evangelization

   In Ecclesia in America, Pope John Paul II calls for a "new
   evangelization" centered on the person of Jesus Christ: "‘The encounter
   with the living Jesus Christ' is ‘the path to conversion, communion and
   solidarity'" (no. 7). This personal encounter with the risen Lord, so
   abundantly recounted in the Gospels, Epistles, and Acts of the
   Apostles, leads to a daily vision of the Lord present and active in the
   world, especially in the poor, in the stranger, and in the migrant and
   refugee. Those most in need draw the members of the Church out of their
   unawareness to a conversion of heart through which they are able to
   offer a genuine and suitable welcome, to share together as brothers and
   sisters at the same table, and to work side by side to improve the
   quality of life for society's most vulnerable members. All of this is
   an expression of the Spirit of the risen Jesus being poured out again
   on his followers.

   The Holy Spirit made manifest at Pentecost enabled people of diverse
   languages and cultures to understand the one message of salvation. The
   new evangelization means openness to the gifts of the Spirit wherever
   they might appear. Our response to the new immigration thus is informed
   by a renewed vision of what it is to be Church, and by a new
   spirituality, informed by the Spirit of Pentecost present in the
   sacrament of confirmation, which gives the power to discern the one
   message of the kingdom in the diverse customs and languages of our
   immigrant brothers and sisters.

   Immigrant communities give ample witness to what it is to be Church—in
   their desire to worship as a people, in their faith, in their
   solidarity with one another and with the weakest among them, in their
   devotion and their faithfulness to the Church of their ancestors. For
   the Church in the United States to walk in solidarity with newcomers to
   our country is to live out our catholicity as a Church. The Church of
   the twenty-first century will be, as it has always been, a Church of
   many cultures, languages and traditions, yet simultaneously one, as God
   is one—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—unity in diversity.

   The new immigration is a reminder of the pilgrim state of the Church,
   made up of all those, regardless of race or class or national origin,
   who have been called to the wedding banquet and have responded (Lk
   14:23). As a pilgrim, the Church encompasses in itself all the reality
   of human suffering and all the glory of the human spirit infused with
   the grace of Christ. With its diverse pilgrim peoples, the Church in
   the United States has known uprootedness and loss, persecution and
   flight, the search for a better life, and the difficulties and
   disappointments of that search. The Church has known God's grace as it
   lifts spirits in times of despair, sustains hope in the face of
   hopelessness, and revives love despite evils and human frailties. In
   the one baptism, the Church acknowledges God's call to conversion,
   while in the sacrament of the Eucharist, she enjoys prefigured the
   glorious communion of Father and Son in the Holy Spirit. At the
   Eucharist the Church prefigures the revelation of "a great multitude .
   . . from every nation, race, people, and tongue" (Rev 7:9).

   In such a Eucharist, on that sunlit Jubilee Day of Migrants and
   Refugees in St. Peter's Square, Pope John Paul II summed up the
   challenge and hope for the Church in the United States as it welcomes
   the immigrants of the new millennium in a very simple but profound
   image:

     Like the disciples of Emmaus, believers, supported by the living
     presence of the risen Christ, become in turn the traveling
     companions of their brothers and sisters in trouble, offering them
     the word which rekindles hope in their hearts. With them they break
     the bread of friendship, brotherhood and mutual help. This is how to
     build the civilization of love. This is how to proclaim the
     hoped-for coming of the new heavens and the new earth to which we
     are heading. (no. 4)


Notes


    1. "In keeping with linguistic convention, the term Romani (also
       spelled Romany in the literature) is used to refer to any or all of
       the Romani dialects or languages. We use ‘Gypsies' to refer to the
       totality of all groups except the Irish and Scottish Travelers, and
       where the identity of the group is unverified." (Taken from Gypsies
       and Travelers in North America: An Annotated Bibliography, William
       G. Lockwood and Sheila Salo [Cheverly, Md.: The Gypsy Lore Society,
       1994].)

    2. In international and U.S. law, "refugees" are those who have fled
       past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution
       on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a
       particular social group, or political opinion. While the United
       States may grant asylum or special consideration to some refugees,
       the process of obtaining such recognition is often fraught with
       difficulties, and many refugees must deal with the immigration
       system on the same terms as other immigrants.

    3. Congress enacted three major laws in 1996 that have had an adverse
       impact on immigrants: (1) the Illegal Immigration Reform and
       Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), (2) the Anti-Terrorism and
       Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), and (3) the Personal
       Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA).
       Taken together, these laws have undermined due process protections
       for immigrants and driven more immigrant families into poverty. The
       combined effect of IIRIRA and AEDPA have subjected immigrants who
       committed minor crimes in their past and have served their sentence
       to mandatory detention and deportation, separating them
       indefinitely from their loved ones. IIRIRA also removed judicial
       discretion for individual cases and increased the standard for
       immigrants to obtain relief from deportation. It further included
       provisions that allow the summary exclusion of asylum seekers from
       this country without the benefit of review of their asylum claims
       by an immigration judge and bars immigrants who reside in the
       country in an undocumented status for more than one year from
       returning to the United States for ten years. PRWORA, the federal
       welfare law, eliminated all legal immigrants from eligibility for
       public benefits. While some of these benefits have been restored,
       virtually all legal immigrants who entered the United States after
       1996 remain ineligible for benefits.

    4. Puerto Ricans, of course, are not immigrants, but many of them face
       the same challenges as recent immigrants. Much of the Hispanic
       population of the Southwestern United States, likewise, can trace
       its ancestry in what is now the United States back many years
       before the appropriation of these territories by the U.S.
       government. While having much in common in language and culture
       with recent immigrants, the Hispanos of New Mexico and many Mexican
       Americans throughout the country today welcome the newcomers in
       their midst as long-established residents of this country. At the
       same time, they have often experienced the discrimination and
       disadvantage associated with representing a subordinate culture in
       the United States, on a par with the experiences of recent
       immigrants.

    5. The term "multicultural," like others surrounding the question of
       immigration, has been much disputed in the United States. Like
       "cultural pluralism," "multicultural" may describe a society in
       which multiple cultures exist peaceably side by side, interacting
       in common social, economic, and political practices, while
       remaining distinct in others; respecting one another; learning from
       one another; and each changing at its own pace accordingly. The
       call for "incorporation" articulated in this letter shares in this
       spirit. It is not a call for "assimilation" or the disappearance of
       one culture into another, but for continuing cooperation in pursuit
       of the common good and with proper respect for the good of each
       cultural tradition and community.

    6. In February 1986 the Pontifical Commission for the Pastoral Care of
       Migrants and the Congregation for Catholic Education wrote a joint
       letter on the place of "Human Mobility in the Formation of Future
       Priests."


   The pastoral statement Welcoming the Stranger Among Us: Unity in
   Diversity was developed by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops'
   Committee on Migration. It was approved by the full body of bishops at
   their November 2000 general meeting as a statement of the National
   Conference of Catholic Bishops and is authorized for publication by the
   undersigned.

The Stranger Introduction
     __________________________________________________________________

   Want more deets? We've also got a complete Online Course about The
   Stranger, with three weeks worth of readings and activities to make
   sure you know your stuff.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What's the first thing you think of when we say the word "absurd"? A
   baby rhino trying to act like a baby goat?  Fashion week? Maybe an
   eleven minute long homage to 80's sitcoms starring a bearded
   psychopath?  Or how about a platypus (have you ever really looked at
   one)?

   Okay—try this absurd tidbit on for size: a man loses his mom, murders a
   dude on a beach, and is sentenced to death.

   Wait. What?

   The Stranger—or L'Étranger, if you want to be all authentically French
   about it (pro-tip: lose the beret and the baguette)—is an absurdist
   novel about a bonafide weirdo named Meursault. This charming guy shoots
   and kills a man, Johnny Cash-style, just to watch him die.

   But this ain't just a feel-bad book about a cold-blooded seaside
   murder. Camus uses all the events leading up to the shooting (and
   Meursault's subsequent trial, and prison sentence) to explore issues of
   meaning and meaninglessness in life. In other words, Camus's book is
   about Philosophy with a capital P.

   So who was this Camus guy, anyway? He was a trés famous French thinker
   known for his philosophy of the absurd, which is a cousin of the
   philosophy of existentialism. But don't go saying that Camus was an
   existentialist—having his philosophical musings pegged as
   existentialism was a huge pet peeve of Camus' back when he was alive
   (and channeling Humphrey Bogart).

   These days, Camus is most famous as the author of three big-deal
   novels: The Stranger (1942), The Plague (1947), and The Fall (1956).
   Starting on The Stranger is a good call: Camus' later novels kept
   getting more complex… which is not to say that The Stranger is
   lightweight. After all, it explores a philosophy that states that the
   world is devoid of all rational meaning.

   But at least one absolutely rational decision came about because of
   Camus' scribblings. In 1957 the Nobel Prize Committee gave him the
   Nobel Prize for Literature for his generally "important literary
   production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the
   problems of the human conscience in our times."

   And once you read The Stranger, you'll understand that handing Camus
   the big daddy of all literary prizes is the exact opposite of
   absurdity. It makes 100%, no-questions-asked sense.

What is The Stranger About and Why Should I Care?

   What do you have in common with Meursault, the murderous,
   semi-sociopathic, unlikeable, unloving, chain-smoking, detached,
   sun-averse protagonist of The Stranger?

   The answer is, uncomfortably, more than you'd think.

   We're guessing that you, dearest Shmooper, are a totally lovely
   individual that wouldn't do hideous things like lose interest during
   your mother's funeral or shoot some random guy in ice-cold blood.
   Actually, we're sure of it.

   But we're equally sure that you—like all of us—have felt weird moments
   of questioning and detachment. We're talking about everything from
   those terrifying midnight episodes where you stare at the ceiling and
   think, "What does it all mean?" to thinking "Oh dang. Is that me?" when
   you hear your voice in a recording, to that deflated feeling you get
   after something big occurs—your birthday, a break-up, an election—and
   you wake up the next day and everything seems… exactly the same as it
   was before.

   Those moments are weird, and you feel weird within them. Or, to put it
   another way: life is pretty strange, and you often feel like a stranger
   (The Stranger, in fact) within it.

   Yes, Meursault is a guy who is emotionally incapable, socially unaware,
   and understands relationships only in the context of the physical. He's
   like Sherlock Holmes or Lisbeth Salander, but weirder and not a
   detective.

   But this stranger is also an introspective philosophical rebel. And the
   philosophy that he and Camus promote—the philosophy of absurdism—states
   that the world is so nonsensical, so absurd, that you can't expect to
   find meaning in it anywhere. There's no logic, no rationale, no
   governing order.

   That might sound kind of insane (and super lonely) to you. But that,
   friends, is exactly the point. Absurdism doesn't say "When life gives
   you lemons, make lemonade." Absurdism says, "When life gives you
   lemons, eat that lemon as if it was a dang apple."

   This philosophical stance isn't everyone's cup of tea (or mouthful of
   lemon pulp). But it can be useful, when faced with the hyper-bizarre
   stuff that life can lob in your direction, to be able to think, "Huh.
   That makes no sense whatsoever," and leave it at that.

   So while we definitely don't advocate that you treat Meursault as a
   role model, we do think that adopting his—and Camus'—philosophy can be
   strangely (hey-o!) comforting.

   Or, you know, you can just read The Stranger because it's a
   crazy-important and seminal text of the 20th Century and helped Albert
   Camus win a Nobel Prize. It's a win-win situation… unlike a lot of the
   absurd situations you come across in this crazy, messed-up world.

   When I'm out with my young children, friendly strangers often approach
   us to smile and say hello. Although I'd like my kids to be polite, I
   also want to teach them not to talk to strangers. How can I avoid
   sending mixed messages?
   – Suzanne

   "Don't talk to strangers" has been the rule for many parents for
   generations. But sometimes it's a good idea for kids to talk to
   strangers. Who else will they turn to if they're lost and need help?

   So, instead of making a rule, it's better to teach kids when it's
   appropriate to talk to strangers and when it is not. When your kids are
   out with you, it's fine to let them say hello and talk to new
   people. You are watching the situation and will protect them.

   But if your child is alone and approached by a stranger, that's a
   different story. Tell your kids that if a stranger ever approaches and
   offers a ride or treats (like candy or toys) or asks for help with a
   task (like helping find a lost dog), they should step away, yell "No!"
   and leave the area immediately. Your child should tell you or another
   trusted adult (like a teacher or childcare worker) what happened. The
   same goes if anyone — whether a stranger, family member, or friend —
   asks your child to keep a secret, tries to touch your child's private
   area, or asks your child to touch theirs.

   Most kids are likely to be wary of strangers who are mean-looking or
   appear scary in some way. But most child molesters and abductors are
   regular-looking people, and many go out of their way to look friendly,
   safe, and appealing to children. So, instead of judging a person by
   appearance, teach kids to judge people by their actions.

   It's also important to encourage kids to trust their own instincts.
   Teach them that if someone makes them feel uncomfortable or if they
   feel like something's just not right — even if they can't explain why —
   they need to walk away immediately.

   So, what happens if your kids are alone and need to approach a stranger
   for help? First, they should try to find a person in uniform, like a
   police officer, security guard, or store employee. If there are no
   uniformed people, look for grandparents, women, and people with
   children who may be able to help. And again, remind them about
   instincts: If they don't have a good feeling about a certain person,
   they should approach someone else.

   It's not possible to protect kids from strangers at all times. But it
   is possible to teach them about appropriate behaviors and what to do if
   somebody crosses the line. Keeping these tips in mind can help your
   kids stay safe while they're out and about.

To a Stranger

   Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you,
   You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me as
   of a dream,)
   I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,
   All is recall’d as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste,
   matured,
   You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me,
   I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours only
   nor left my body mine only,
   You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, you
   take of my beard, breast, hands, in return,
   I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or wake
   at night alone,
   I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again,
   I am to see to it that I do not lose you.

   This poem is in the public domain.
   Walt Whitman

   Born on May 31, 1819, Walt Whitman is the author of Leaves of
   Grass and, along with Emily Dickinson, is considered one of the
   architects of a uniquely American poetic voice.

To Think of Time

1

To think of time—of all that retrospection!
To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!

Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?
Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?

Is to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing?
If the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing.

To think that the sun rose in the east! that men and women
   were flexible, real, alive! that everything was alive!
To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our
   part!
To think that we are now here, and bear our part!

2

Not a day passes—not a minute or second, without an
   accouchement!
Not a day passes—not a minute or second, without a corpse!

The dull nights go over, and the dull days also,
The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,
The physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible
   look for an answer,
The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters
   are sent for,
Medicines stand unused on the shelf—(the camphor-smell has
   long pervaded the rooms,)
The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,
The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,
The breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,
The corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,
It is palpable as the living are palpable.

The living look upon the corpse with their eye-sight,
But without eye-sight lingers a different living, and looks curiously
   on the corpse.

3

To think the thought of Death, merged in the thought of materials!
To think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and fruits ripen,
   and act upon others as upon us now—yet not act upon us!
To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking
   great interest in them—and we taking no interest in them!

To think how eager we are in building our houses!
To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent!

(I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy
   or eighty years at most,
I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)

Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth—they never
   cease—they are the burial lines,
He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall
   surely be buried.

4

A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,
A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,
Each after his kind:
Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf—posh and ice in the river,
   half-frozen mud in the streets, a gray, discouraged sky overhead,
   the short, last daylight of Twelfth-month,
A hearse and stages—other vehicles give place—the funeral
   of an old Broadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers.

Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the gate
   is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the
   hearse uncloses,
The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on the
   coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,
The mound above is flatted with the spades—silence,
A minute—no one moves or speaks—it is done,
He is decently put away—is there anything more?

He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking,
   able to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with
   life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty,
   drank hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited
   toward the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution, died, aged
   forty-one years—and that was his funeral.

Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-weather
   clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler,
   somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man before
   and man behind, good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean
   stock, first out, last out, turning-in at night;
To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers—and
   he there takes no interest in them!

5

The markets, the government, the working-man's wages—to think what
   account they are through our nights and days!
To think that other working-men will make just as great account of
   them—yet we make little or no account!

The vulgar and the refined—what you call sin, and what you call
   goodness—to think how wide a difference!
To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond
   the difference.

To think how much pleasure there is!
Have you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from poems?
Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a
   nomination and election? or with your wife and family?
Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful
   maternal cares?
—These also flow onward to others—you and I flow onward,
But in due time, you and I shall take less interest in them.

Your farm, profits, crops,—to think how engross'd you are!
To think there will still be farms, profits, crops—yet for you, of
   what avail?

6

What will be, will be well—for what is, is well,
To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.

The sky continues beautiful,
The pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure of
   women with men, nor the pleasure from poems,
The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of
   houses—these are not phantasms—they have weight, form,
   location;
Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them
   phantasms,
The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,
The earth is not an echo—man and his life, and all the things of
   his life, are well-consider'd.

You are not thrown to the winds—you gather certainly and safely
   around yourself;
Yourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever!

7

It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and
   father—it is to identify you;
It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided;
Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,
You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.

The threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the warp,
   the pattern is systematic.

The preparations have every one been justified,
The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments—the
   baton has given the signal.

The guest that was coming—he waited long, for reasons—he
   is now housed,
He is one of those who are beautiful and happy—he is one of
   those that to look upon and be with is enough.

The law of the past cannot be eluded,
The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,
The law of the living cannot be eluded—it is eternal,
The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,
The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,
The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons—not one iota thereof
   can be eluded.

8

Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,
Northerner goes carried, and Southerner goes carried, and they on the
   Atlantic side, and they on the Pacific, and they between, and all
   through the Mississippi country, and all over the earth.

The great masters and kosmos are well as they go—the heroes and
   good-doers are well,
The known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and
   distinguish'd, may be well,
But there is more account than that—there is strict account
   of all.

The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,
The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,
The common people of Europe are not nothing—the American
   aborigines are not nothing,
The infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing—the
   murderer or mean person is not nothing,
The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as
   they go,
The lowest prostitute is not nothing—the mocker of religion
   is not nothing as he goes.

9

Of and in all these things,
I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law
   of us changed,
I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present
   and past law,
And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present
   and past law,
For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.

If otherwise, all came but to ashes of dung,
If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray'd!
Then indeed suspicion of death.

Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die
   now,
Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward
   annihilation?

10

Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,
Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,
The whole universe indicates that it is good,
The past and the present indicate that it is good.

How beautiful and perfect are the animals!
How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!

What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just
   as perfect,
The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable
   fluids are perfect;
Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely
   they yet pass on.

11

I swear I think now that everything without exception has an
   eternal Soul!
The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have!
   the animals!

I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!
That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is
   for it, and the cohering is for it;
And all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life
   and materials are altogether for it!

   Walt Whitman

   1855

This Compost

   1
   Something startles me where I thought I was safest,
   I withdraw from the still woods I loved,
   I will not go now on the pastures to walk,
   I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea,
   I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me.
   O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken?
   How can you be alive you growths of spring?
   How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?
   Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?
   Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour dead?
   Where have you disposed of their carcasses?
   Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations?
   Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
   I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv'd,
   I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through the
   sod and turn it up underneath,
   I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.
   2
   Behold this compost! behold it well!
   Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick person—yet behold!
   The grass of spring covers the prairies,
   The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,
   The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,
   The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,
   The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its
   graves,
   The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,
   The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds sit on
   their nests,
   The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,
   The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, the
   colt from the mare,
   Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green leaves,
   Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in the
   dooryards,
   The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of
   sour dead.
   What chemistry!
   That the winds are really not infectious,
   That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which is
   so amorous after me,
   That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its
   tongues,
   That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited
   themselves in it,
   That all is clean forever and forever,
   That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,
   That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,
   That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that
   melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will
      none of them poison me,
   That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,
   Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once a
   catching disease.
   Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,
   It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,
   It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless
   successions of diseas'd corpses,
   It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,
   It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous
   crops,
   It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from
   them at last.

   Walt Whitman

   1856

Thoughts

   1.
   OF the visages of things—And of piercing through
            to the accepted hells beneath;
   Of ugliness—To me there is just as much in it as
            there is in beauty—And now the ugliness of
            human beings is acceptable to me;
   Of detected persons—To me, detected persons are
            not, in any respect, worse than undetected per-
            sons—and are not in any respect worse than I
            am myself;
   Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, is
            equally criminal—and any reputable person is
            also—and the President is also.
   2.
   OF waters, forests, hills;
   Of the earth at large, whispering through medium of
            me;
   Of vista—Suppose some sight in arriere, through the
            formative chaos, presuming the growth, fulness,
            life, now attain'd on the journey;
   (But I see the road continued, and the journey ever
            continued;)
   Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time
            has become supplied—And of what will yet be
            supplied,
   Because all I see and know, I believe to have purport
            in what will yet be supplied.
   3.
   OF persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies,
            wealth, scholarships, and the like;
   To me, all that those persons have arrived at, sinks
            away from them, except as it results to their
            Bodies and Souls,
   So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked;
   And often, to me, each one mocks the others, and
            mocks himself or herself,
   And of each one, the core of life, namely happiness,
            is full of the rotten excrement of maggots,
   And often, to me, those men and women pass unwit-
            tingly the true realities of life, and go toward
            false realities,
   And often, to me, they are alive after what custom has
            served them, but nothing more,
   And often, to me, they are sad, hasty, unwaked son-
            nambules, walking the dusk.
   4.
   OF ownership—As if one fit to own things could not
            at pleasure enter upon all, and incorporate
            them into himself or herself;
   Of Equality—As if it harm'd me, giving others the
            same chances and rights as myself—As if it
            were not indispensable to my own rights that
            others possess the same;
   Of Justice—As if Justice could be anything but the
            same ample law, expounded by natural judges
            and saviors,
   As if it might be this thing or that thing, according
            to decisions.
   5.
   As I sit with others, at a great feast, suddenly, while
            the music is playing,
   To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral,
            in mist, of a wreck at sea,
   Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations,
            founder'd off the Northeast coast, and going
            down—Of the steamship Arctic going down,
   Of the veil'd tableau—Women gather'd together on
            deck, pale, heroic, waiting the moment that
            draws so close—O the moment!
   O the huge sob—A few bubbles—the white foam
            spirting up—And then the women gone,
   Sinking there, while the passionless wet flows on—
            And I now pondering, Are those women indeed
            gone?
   Are Souls drown'd and destroy'd so?
   Is only matter triumphant?
   6.
   OF what I write from myself—As if that were not the
            resumé;
   Of Histories—As if such, however complete, were not
            less complete than my poems;
   As if the shreds, the records of nations, could possibly
            be as lasting as my poems;
   As if here were not the amount of all nations, and of
            all the lives of heroes.
   7.
   OF obedience, faith, adhesiveness;
   As I stand aloof and look, there is to me something
            profoundly affecting in large masses of men,
            following the lead of those who do not believe
            in men.

Who Is a Stranger?

Defining a Stranger

   A stranger is anyone that your family doesn't know well. It's common
   for children to think that "bad strangers" look scary, like the
   villains in cartoons. This is not only not true, but it's dangerous for
   children to think this way. Pretty strangers can be just as dangerous
   as the not-so-pretty ones. When you talk to your children about
   strangers, explain that no one can tell if strangers are nice or not
   nice just by looking at them and that they should be careful around all
   strangers.

   But don't make it seem like all strangers are bad. If children need
   help-whether they're lost, being threatened by a bully, or being
   followed by a stranger-the safest thing for them to do in many cases is
   to ask a stranger for help. You can make this easier for them by
   showing them which strangers are okay to trust.

Who Are Safe Strangers?

   Safe strangers are people children can ask for help when they need it.
   Police officers and firefighters are two examples of very recognizable
   safe strangers. Teachers, principals, and librarians are adults
   children can trust too, and they are easy to recognize when they're at
   work. But make sure that you emphasize that whenever possible, children
   should go to a public place to ask for help.

   You can help your children recognize safe strangers by pointing them
   out when you're out in your town. Also show your children places they
   can go if they need help, such as local stores and restaurants and the
   homes of family friends in your neighborhood.

   A whirlwind romance with a handsome and charming stranger who sweeps
   Cecily Harrington off her feet. Little does she know the ghastly truth
   about her new beau…

More about this story

   Cecily Harrington has led a staid and proper existence. After winning a
   large amount of money in a sweepstake she desperately yearns for a life
   of adventure. Enter Bruce Lovell, a handsome and charming stranger who
   sweeps her off her feet. In a whirlwind romance, she recklessly
   abandons her job, friends and fiancé to settle in the remote and
   blissful surroundings of a country cottage. However, her newfound “love
   from a stranger” is not what it seems and in an astonishingly tense
   final scene, Cecily discovers the ghastly truth of her new love.

   An intense and chilling psychological thriller which examines the
   sadistic mind of a serial killer and the extremes to which the power of
   suggestion can be pushed.

   A brilliant terror play … our blood was gloriously curdled.

     The Daily Herald

   Love From a Stranger is an adaptation by Agatha Christie and Frank
   Vosper which draws both on Christie's earlier play, The Stranger, and
   her short story, Philomel Cottage. Some years before this play,
   Christie herself wrote a stage version, calling it The Stranger. Love
   from a Stranger opened at the New Theatre (now Noël Coward) in the West
   End in 1936. It was then reworked for film a year later, starring Ann
   Harding and Basil Rathbone. The play was then televised in 1938, live
   on BBC Television. When the story was adapted for the American
   half-hour radio programme Suspense it starred Orson Welles as Gerald.
   2018 welcomes a new UK tour of Love From a Stranger. Find out more.

   Stephanie Cole was a frightened teen on her first day at a new job.
   When she froze during a transaction, a customer had some kind words for
   her.
   Stephanie Cole

   This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain
   team, about people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone
   else.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The first day at a new job can be hard. Especially when it's your first
   job ever, and you're starting during the Christmas rush.

   Stephanie Cole's first job as a teenager was in retail, working at a
   busy department store in 1960s Los Angeles.

   "There I was in my black skirt and my white blouse, and ready to go the
   first day," Cole recalled.

   Her training had been quick, and the store was now bustling with people
   trying to finish their holiday shopping. It wasn't long before a woman
   walked up to her cash register with a Christmas tree ornament that she
   wanted to buy. Cole froze.

   "All of a sudden, I can't remember anything. I can't remember how to
   run the cash register. I can't remember anything about the
   transactions. I am just absolutely frozen and probably very close to
   tears," she said.

   She'd wanted this first job to go well, and it was already going very
   wrong. But the woman looked at her with a kind expression and said,
   "It's alright. Take your time. I'm not in a hurry."

   Cole felt a sense of relief when she heard those words. "All of a
   sudden, I could breathe, I could wait till somebody else could help me.
   It was gonna be okay."

   The moment was a small one long ago, but the woman's kindness affected
   how Cole has interacted with people ever since.

   "She gave me that gift without knowing she gave me that gift. And it's
   lasted all these years," Cole said.

   "You know, you encounter somebody who's . . . just having a bad day and
   things are really, you can tell they're in a bad place, and you can
   say, 'It's okay. I'm not in a hurry. Take your time.' And it always
   makes the situation better. Always, always."

   My Unsung Hero is also a podcast — new episodes are released every
   Tuesday. To share the story of your unsung hero with the Hidden Brain
   team, record a voice memo on your phone and send it to

   Sometimes I think I’m watching a Fellini movie, one of those really
   strange ones where I witness something so bizarre that I think I’m
   hallucinating — except it turns out to be real.

   So, was I hallucinating when I heard there were more than two genders,
   more than boys and girls, men and women, male and female — and that men
   could get pregnant?

   You tell me. At a congressional hearing, when asked, “Can biological
   men become pregnant and give birth?” a doctor from Planned Parenthood
   said, “Men can have pregnancies. … Somebody with a uterus may have the
   capability of becoming pregnant, whether they’re a woman or a man.”

   While you’re scratching your head over that, let’s move down to our
   southern border, the one Vice President Kamala Harris assures us is
   “secure.” But on television I see thousands of illegal immigrants
   walking into the United States every day — more than 2 million a year,
   according to official records.

   Maybe Harris is right and my eyes are wrong. Maybe I’m hallucinating
   and not really seeing what I think I’m seeing.

   What about the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan — you know, the chaotic
   mess that President Biden called a “success”?

   Wasn’t that the withdrawal that was marred by a terrorist attack that
   killed more than 180 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members? And didn’t we
   leave behind tens of billions of dollars in military equipment that
   fell into the hands of the Taliban?

   Good thing it was a “success,” right? Or maybe I’m just imagining all
   the bad stuff.  Hallucinations will do that.

   Here’s more good news: “The pandemic is over.” I know that because
   President Biden — the same president who said the withdrawal from
   Afghanistan was a success — has told us it’s over.

   But if it’s really “over” why are between 400 and 500 Americans still
   dying every day of COVID-19? Somebody must be hallucinating because the
   president of the United States says “the pandemic is over.”

   But wait. If it’s really over, why is the Biden administration
   “forgiving” up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for certain
   borrowers to make sure they are “not placed in a worse position
   financially because of the pandemic” — you know, the one that’s “over”?

   I’m not sure if I’m simply confused or if I’m still hallucinating —
   because I thought crime in our big cities was a real problem. But you’d
   be hard-pressed to find a progressive district attorney anywhere in the
   United States who thinks crime is a big deal, or at least will say so
   publicly. Or, as The Atlantic magazine put it, “Refusing to admit the
   gravity of the [crime] problem won’t make it go away.”

   Merrick Garland’s unprecedented dilemma Putin misjudged Ukraine. Is the
   West falling into a similar trap with Russia and China?

   Even Federico Fellini might think he was watching one of his own
   strange movies if he were alive and witnessing what passes for reality
   in the United States, circa 2022. And why wouldn’t he? After all, we’re
   told that the bloody U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is a “success.”
   We’re assured that even though the coronavirus is killing hundreds of
   Americans every day, “the pandemic is over.” We know that millions of
   illegal immigrants enter the United States in a single year but we’re
   supposed to believe that the border is “secure.” Statistics tell us
   crime is on the rise but progressives believe it isn’t. And, of course,
   men can get pregnant.

   Yes, up is down, east is west, day is night, and mostly, lies are
   truth. Fellini may have been a master at mixing fantasy with reality,
   but what’s going on today in the United States, I suspect, would be too
   bizarre, even for him.

Do I Know You? What’s the difference between a stranger and a strange person?

   Is there a “strange” “person stranger” difference in meaning? Yes!

   “Talk to strangers every day!”  I tell my students.  “If you want to
   improve your English more quickly, speak with strangers whenever and
   wherever you can.”

   strange person stranger difference 1

   Often they look shocked.  “I don’t want to talk to strangers,” they
   say.  “I cross the street when I see a stranger.”

   That’s how I know they are probably confused.

   When I say “stranger,” I mean a person they don’t know, a person they
   haven’t met before.

   They think I mean “a strange person,” someone who behaves strangely and
   makes them feel uncomfortable.

   If you sit next to a stranger on a bus or in a coffee shop, start a
   conversation.

   If you sit next to a strange person, you may want to change your seat.
   strange person stranger difference 2

   When you meet a stranger, practice your English.  Make small talk like
   “Nice weather, eh?” or “Long line, huh?”

   strange person stranger difference 3 When you see a strange person, you
   can take a photo for Facebook or Instagram.  For a caption, write “Keep
   Portland Weird.”

   So, try to use this “strange” “person stranger” difference in the real
   world when talking to people in English!

   CONDUIT TO CREATIVITY

To come up with more creative ideas, try talking to a stranger

   Science suggests it might be the best tactic for finding new and novel
   ideas

   When psychology lecturer Gillian Sandstrom began her master’s degree at
   Ryerson University, she’d walk from the research lab to her
   supervisor’s office in downtown Toronto. Gillian usually passed the
   same hot dog stand along the way. Day after day, she’d walk by the
   stand. And eventually, without meaning to, she struck up a relationship
   with the woman who worked there.

   “Every day when I walked past her, I would smile and wave,” she says in
   a podcast with the American Psychological Association. “She would wave
   back, and it just really made me feel good. And so I just started
   wondering—what’s going on here? Is this just me, or is this a thing?”
   Advertisement

   The question, she says, led her into her field of work: researching
   minimal social interactions, small interactions with strangers or
   acquaintances that can change the way we think and feel for the better.

   Perhaps it’s no surprise that connecting with a stranger prompted
   Sandstrom’s larger thinking. A new study from behavioral researchers
   reveals that interacting with strangers can be a key tactic for coming
   up with new ideas.

Brainstorm with strangers, refine with friends

   An emerging body of research already shows that talking with strangers
   can make us feel more optimistic and positive, scale up our empathy,
   boost our belonging, and gift us a sense of connection. This research,
   though, considers the impact strangers have on our ideas.

   The study looks to the role of our relationships in creative
   idea-making, drawing a line between the people who know us well and
   those who don’t. And it finds that those we have strong relationships
   with, like parents, partners, and close friends, aren’t actually the
   best people to help us brainstorm new endeavors. Instead, we should
   look to those we have looser connections with.

   The difference divides between strong ties, or those close
   relationships, and weak ties, which includes distant companions, casual
   acquaintances, and even strangers. And the research finds that the
   latter group can help us generate more and better initial ideas. The
   less we know someone, the more likely they are to challenge our
   creative process.

   “Weak ties increase the chance of ‘creative accidents’ by providing
   diverse notions that collide in the brain,” the authors write. In other
   words, strangers and other people who have some distance from us can
   offer unfamiliar perspectives—which helps prompt more flexible,
   creative thinking from us. We’re even more likely to give novel
   insights and fresh perspectives more consideration when they come from
   someone we don’t know well.

   Pier Vittorio Mannucci, a Bocconi University management professor and
   one of the study’s co-authors, even put the theory to the test in his
   own life. Mannucci was writing a children’s book, I corsari del tempo
   (or The Time Pirates), where the main character discovers a site for
   time travel—along with other time travelers themselves. While
   brainstorming, he reached out to casual acquaintances who’d spent time
   in international places where the book would be set. The conversations
   he had helped him surface and settle on his creative direction.

   That’s not to say that the people we’re close to don’t have a role to
   play in helping us with our ideas. On the contrary, the people we
   consider our strong ties—our trusted collaborators, co-conspirators,
   and confidantes—are better for going deep on those ideas. That’s
   because they often share similar backgrounds or perspectives with us.
   “Instead of gaining new insights,” the researchers add, consulting with
   close connections can help build upon your existing knowledge or
   assumptions.

   More simply, as Mannucci puts it: generate ideas with strangers, then
   elaborate on them with friends.

4 Signs That a Stranger Poses Danger

Not paranoia, but preparedness. How to separate the helpful from the harmful.

   Strangers often turn into friends, co-workers, or even life partners.
   We are motivated to view others positively, because of this potential
   for building productive relationships. Yet sensing danger should
   curtail your initial level of courtesy.

   Strangers Are Statistically Safe

   As we prepare to head into April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness
   Month, we begin with the observation that most strangers are safe — or
   at least harmless. As strange as it sounds to put it that way,
   statistically speaking, it is true. Yet it is precisely because the
   majority of people are harmless that we extend the benefit of the doubt
   to those who are not.

   To put the danger into perspective, I have spent the last 20-plus years
   prosecuting the exceptions to the harmless stranger rule. And those
   exceptions will keep myself and my colleagues in the District
   Attorney's Office employed for the rest of our careers. In other words,
   the level of risk from stranger danger is statistically low, but
   significantly serious.

   This risk is enhanced by the reality that in most cases, we are unable
   to spot dangerous people merely by looking. Actions speak louder than
   words, and appearances can be deceiving. Here are some safety
   strategies to help you separate the harmful from the harmless.

   Context Counts

   Stranger danger includes both risk of criminal behavior and of sexual
   harassment — which even if it does not include physical contact, can
   have significant adverse consequences.

   Research indicates that stranger harassment results in more negative
   outcomes than workplace harassment, with incidents involving physical
   contact causing the most negative reactions.[1] It further reveals that
   harassment taking place at a bar caused less negative reactions than
   harassment at a store or at an office, a finding believed to be
   consistent with the interaction between perceived sexual harassment and
   permissive social norms.[2]

   Yet not all strangers display harassing behavior. Some are even more
   dangerous, charming, and disarming by clothing themselves in courtesy.
   These wolves in sheep's clothing prey on victims by capitalizing on
   social norms of helpfulness and cooperation in either requesting or
   offering assistance.

   Requests for Personal Assistance

   We all want to live by the biblical and social mandate, “Do unto
   others.” Following the Golden Rule, we would love to help everyone in
   all situations. But beware of the seemingly able-bodied stranger who
   approaches you requesting assistance, particularly in an environment
   with lots of available options, such as train stations and airports.

   This person may be harmless, but you should remain attuned to your
   instincts. Direct someone who makes you uncomfortable to an information
   counter or to local authorities for help. And in an era when almost
   everyone has a cell phone, do not feel pressured to lend someone yours,
   which will give them access to your personal information, including
   private numbers, passwords, and photographs of your kids.

   Assistance Insistence

   Some people, both good and bad, offer assistance instead of requesting
   it. As a general rule, helpful people are wonderful, as we welcome both
   aid and altruism.

   Helping behavior enhances interpersonal warmth, because helping is
   believed to demonstrate kindness.[3] Helping also generates perceived
   competence through demonstrating valuable skills or essential
   information, resulting in elevated status attributed to the helper.[4]

   Yet a stranger's true intentions are often revealed in reaction to your
   response. While most strangers are gracious whether you accept their
   help or not, a further offer becomes inappropriate after you have
   declined assistance.

   It is appropriate to accept a stranger's offer to lift your heavy
   briefcase into the overhead compartment on a crowded airplane. It is
   inappropriate to have a stranger approach you outside your neighborhood
   market and insist on carrying your groceries to your car — particularly
   after you have said “no.” Be wary of any sentence that begins with “I
   insist.” And keep a firm grasp on your belongings when declining
   assistance, as a predator intent on pursuing an opportunity for sexual
   assault will attempt to grab your belongings right out of your hand.

   The Open Nook

   When you meet friendly strangers, your level of disclosure will depend
   on your level of comfort. Remember that it is not rude to keep personal
   details to yourself. Along these lines, beware the open book (or the
   open "nook" in the digital era).

   Predators may attempt to elicit personal details from you by revealing
   their own. Providing too much information, or “TMI," can be a ploy to
   create a sense of obligation on your part to reciprocate. Don't fall
   for it. There is no rule of reciprocity that requires you to share
   private details with a stranger, regardless of how much they share with
   you.

   And remember that you cannot always judge a book by its cover. When
   getting to know a new acquaintance, what you assumed was an authentic

   We remind our children to mind their manners, and we try to do the
   same. Yet with a stranger who makes you uncomfortable, don't. If you
   realize you have allowed someone who makes you uncomfortable to get a
   foot in the door, close it.

Most Americans 'feel like stranger' in US: survey

More than half of respondents believe US headed in wrong direction, poll
shows

   WASHINGTON

   Most Americans "feel like a stranger" in their own country, according
   to a poll.

   Axios/Survey Monkey poll showed that 60% of adults said they agreed
   that "things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in
   my own country."

   Of 2,811 respondents, 24% said they "completely agree" and 36% said
   they "mostly agree" with the statement.

   The poll also found that 67% of those polled were angry about the way
   things are going in the country. As well, 62% found themselves feeling
   angry about current events and the news.

   More than half of the respondents, or 59%, said things in the U.S. are
   now headed in the wrong direction.

   The respondents were also asked to respond to the way U.S. President
   Donald Trump is handling his job, with 54% disapproved while 44%
   approved.

   The poll was conducted from Oct. 17 - 20, nearly a week before House
   Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry following claims by a
   whistle-blower that the president sought to pressure Ukraine to
   interfere in the 2020 presidential elections.

   In a July 25 telephone call, Trump repeatedly pressed Ukraine President
   Volodymyr Zelensky to launch a probe into former U.S. Vice President
   Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, a businessman, over unsubstantiated
   corruption allegations.

   The elder Biden is a leading candidate in the race for the Democratic
   nomination to challenge Trump for the presidency in 2020.

   Trump, a Republican, has accused Democrats of time-wasting and says the
   House inquiry amounts to a “lynching,” maintaining he did nothing
   wrong.

   The Stranger, The Outsider and The Foreigner

The Stranger, The Outsider and The Foreigner

   Thomas Benson

   Translation is, at best, the science of ‘best fit’. Whether in the
   euphemistic, guarded language of politics or the allusive,
   metaphor-heavy literary world, words always carry far more weight than
   just their simple face value, carrying hidden references and allusions.
   The word ‘straight’, for instance on the surface just means linear- a
   ‘straight road’. Yet it carries a whole bundle of associated meanings;
   it can signify honesty, sexuality, neatness, seriousness. A quick look
   at the online Oxford Dictionary shows you the extent of the meanings
   stemming from this simple word.

   This makes the lives of translators very problematic, and the
   difficulties are nowhere more pronounced than in literature. Take the
   title of Camus’ most famous book- L’Étranger. In French, this word
   carries three associated but nevertheless distinct meanings: the
   stranger, the foreigner and the outsider. All of these words have some
   degree of claim to representing the French title, and conveying Camus’
   intentions, but none of them can truly represent the meaning of the
   original word. As it is, the title is usually translated as either The
   Outsider or The Stranger, although The Outsider proves the less popular
   choice; probably due to the phonic similarity between ‘stranger’ and
   the original title.

   Moving beyond the title into the first line, one of the most famous in
   French literature – ‘Aujourd’hui, maman est mort’- and the debate
   continues. How do we translate ‘maman’? Mersault, the main character,
   is a cold, unfeeling outsider (or stranger); the choice of how he
   reacts to his mother’s death will set the tone for the novel as a
   whole. Mother is too cold and formal, mum is too monosyllabic and
   informal. ‘Maman’ sits between the two and is the reason that Matthew
   Ward left it untranslated in his edition (he also plumped for The
   Stranger).  Recently, a new edition of L’Étranger was published that
   translated the line as ‘My mother died today’, introducing a new warmth
   and sentimental attachment.

   The debate then is over the structure of the line itself. Should the
   structure of the sentence remain the same- ‘Today, mother died’- or the
   more fluid ‘Mother died today’? While the latter sounds more
   Anglophonic, it carries none of the associated meaning of Camus’
   original. It is significant that Mersault lists the time before the
   death of his mother. He lives without a concept of past and future,
   living in the present. He concentrates on his life as it happens,
   disregarding the past and not bothering to foretell the future
   consequences of his actions; his emotional and temporal detachment
   render him cold, uncaring, and unlikeable. ‘Today, mother died’ is far
   more consistent with his outlook and with the next sentence of the
   novel- ‘or yesterday; I don’t know.’

   So much to consider from the first sentence, and the task of the
   translator will not get much easier throughout the novel. Exploring the
   minefield of meaning is a difficult task, but an enjoyable one; a form
   of mental yoga, stretching meanings and contorting sentence structure
   until the original intent of the author is adequately conveyed. It is
   just a shame that Camus himself is not around; it would have been
   interesting to see which translation he chose.

The Stranger What’s Up With the Title?

   Advertisement - Guide continues below
   Previous Next

   What’s Up With the Title?

   Before you start humming The Doors' "People Are Strange," hold up.
   We're not just dealing with Meursault being a total weirdo; we're
   dealing with translation, colonialism, and existential angst.

   Let's start with: "What is the title?" In case you didn't know, Camus
   was French; so he wrote The Stranger in French, and, because it seemed
   appropriate, gave it a French title: L'Étranger. Here's where things
   get tricky—in the translation. "L'Étranger" could have easily been
   translated as "The Foreigner" instead of as "The Stranger," and
   actually is in some cases.

   Translations aside, it's more fun to argue semantics. Let's run with
   this "foreigner" bit. Our main character, Meursault, is a French man
   living in French Algiers. In some senses, yes, this makes him a
   foreigner to the land, but the text establishes that in fact his family
   has lived there for several generations—in a colonialist capacity, yes,
   but they've still been around. They know Algeria. More likely,
   Meursault is a metaphorical foreigner. We know this guy is detachment
   personified, so it's easy to argue that he's a foreigner to society, to
   common, human customs—he's an "outsider" (yet another possible
   translation for the title, by the way).

   This is based on the word "foreigner," but the same thing applies to
   the title The Stranger. Meursault is a stranger among other people
   because he is so isolated from them—mentally, emotionally, spiritually,
   and, by the end of the text, physically (he's imprisoned).

   He's strange. He's the strangest. He's the stranger.

The Need to Belong Is Part of Being Human

   [4425c18e1034e70c6b4921c33ccfe2e99b834691.jpeg]
   By Ximena Veliz
   InterNations member Ximena, a Chilean expat turned intercultural coach,
   talks about the powerful need of people to belong — and about how being
   a foreigner doesn’t have to mean feeling like a stranger.

   Our community of foreigners keeps on growing all around the world. As
   per Mr. Wu Hongbo, UN’s Under Secretary General, the number of migrants
   worldwide has just hit 232 million. Commonly used words today are
   expat, TCK (third culture kid), or migrant. For the sake of this
   article I would like to ask you to acknowledge all foreigners,
   regardless of their circumstances or reasons for living outside their
   country of birth or of origin. Everyone has a story!

   Two definitions of foreigner from the Oxford English Dictionary:
    1. A person born in or coming from a country other than one’s own;
    2. A person not belonging to a particular place or group; a stranger
       or outsider.

Becoming a Foreigner

   A new project excites you, yet it might also scare you. You get the
   news of a transfer via your employer, or you decide to move because you
   have fallen in love with someone in another country. Perhaps you want
   to learn the language. For some it’s fleeing their country for
   political reasons and for others it’s following a childhood dream of
   discovering the world. Whatever the reason, the moment you make that
   decision or you receive the confirmation and it becomes official, that
   is the moment your life changes forever.

   When I was twelve and moved to Miami, Florida, from Arica, Chile, I had
   already moved from Santiago to Arica the previous year — and now to
   another country with another language. I was so excited about the
   newness of it all, and at the same time I was sad and scared to leave
   family and friends behind again. I was afraid of not fitting in, not
   being able to learn the language, not making friends.

   That was 38 years ago: since then I have moved many times, travelled a
   lot and continue to do so as much as I can. I also learned French,
   which was a great bonus considering the fear I had at first about
   learning English. Today I am a foreigner even in Chile. But it wasn’t
   easy settling into the "foreigner" status at 12, and then again at 17,
   and then again and again, until I finally understood that being a
   foreigner (definition one) was not the same as being a foreigner
   (definition two).

Don’t Be a Stranger! Being A Foreigner Doesn’t Mean You Don’t Belong

   So yes, change can be exhilarating: the energy is high and positive
   while you are in the process of planning to meet new people, make new
   friends and start afresh. But when that takes some time and you begin
   to tell yourself that you have no time to go out, or you are tired and
   spend too much time alone, you will feel the excitement fading away and
   you will begin to settle into your new life as an outsider, as
   foreigner (2) — a person not belonging to a particular place or group,
   a stranger or outsider.

   Foreigner (2) happens to teens when they transition from childhood to
   adulthood, and of course it can happen to you even in your own country.
   It happens very often and to many people even if they don’t talk about
   it. As an intercultural coach I know about this phenomenon because I
   experienced it firsthand and because I lived in Geneva, Switzerland,
   where foreigners make up 50% of the population. The feeling of not
   belonging anywhere is very strong and it brings you to an unfamiliar
   place, where you feel alone and misunderstood.

   People at home remember your enthusiasm: they remind you of the amazing
   opportunity you had, but you cannot get the zest back and the reality
   doesn’t look as amazing as the dream looked. Your energy is low and you
   just don’t feel too great. This is because humans need to belong,
   remember this.

   If you haven’t found a group of friends or just one friend to take
   walks with, talk to, play games with, or simply go have a cup of coffee
   with, you are floating around on your own in a new place. You will
   continue to feel that something is missing or that something is wrong.
   You might even blame the place, when in fact it’s you, and you can
   change it very quickly!

Finding "Your People"

   I send my clients to InterNations no matter where they are in the
   world. I tell them to just go mingle and meet like-minded people as
   they are mostly going through some of the same things, have recently
   moved and started new jobs, sometimes ended relationships, and they are
   feeling just as misplaced. Many — including myself — find a place to
   belong to and perhaps go hiking, attend a book club group, or join a
   sailing group, and if they don’t find a group doing something they
   like, they can create their own.

   I suggest you do this while your enthusiasm is high, so plan ahead of a
   move and schedule some outings. Later it gets harder when you begin to
   feel the separation and the feeling of not belonging. But if you are
   already in that place where it’s hard to get out and meet people, I
   suggest you start from scratch and remember the feeling of enthusiasm
   you had before moving and pretend to be moving now, no matter how long
   ago that actually was: go for it and get the zest back as there are
   people waiting to meet you.

   I am often asked, even by colleagues in the mental health field, "What
   is Depersonalization Disorder?" For doctors and patients alike,
   Depersonalization Disorder, or DPD, is somewhat mysterious and
   difficult to define. And yet, some researchers consider it to be the
   third most common mental disorder, after depression and anxiety.
   Several research studies indicate that more than half of college
   students have experienced elements of depersonalization at one time or
   another. And many creative people, such as Poe or Sartre, have suffered
   from it. Deuce Bigelow director Harris Goldberg explored his
   experiences of depersonalization in the movie Numb.

   Depersonalization may happen when you first wake up, or while flying on
   an airplane. You may link it to acute trauma or years of chronic
   stress, or to nothing at all. Sometimes it happens after smoking
   marijuana or using "club drugs."

   The first signs are often felt as a "mental break." Suddenly,
   inexplicably, something changes—common objects and familiar situations
   seem strange or foreign, as if you've found yourself in an unfamiliar
   world. And at the same time, you feel unreal or "not yourself." You
   close your eyes and turn inward, but the very thoughts running through
   your head seem different. Patients feel as if they have no self that
   formerly enabled them to deal with the world around them, and with
   their inner world.

   The most clinically true and psychologically sharp descriptions of
   depersonalization are those given by people with DPD. In his excellent
   book, Stranger to Myself, medical journalist and DPD survivor Jeffrey
   Abugel summarizes eight symptoms a person with DPD may experience.

   Feeling panic. When a person first experiences DPD, he often feels as
   if he is going mad. Patients report feeling panic-stricken, trapped
   inside themselves, or thrown into an unfamiliar world they can't
   escape.

   Lack of emotion. People with DPD describe feeling inhuman, like a robot
   or a rock. They experience a loss of spirit, an absence of emotions,
   and no mood changes.

   Feeling detached. People with DPD feel distant from others and
   themselves. Many describe the feeling of watching themselves, as if
   from above. Once-familiar objects seem strange.

   Fixation/obsession. People with DPD repeatedly check their sanity. They
   sometimes fixate on the strangeness or foreignness of a single thought
   or object.

   Abstract ruminating. People with DPD often dwell on the ideas of
   eternity and infinity. They think over and over about the nature of
   existence or the void and the dark mysteries of life.

   Lifestyle changes. People with DPD are sometimes afraid to leave their
   houses or engage in activities that might trigger panic attacks. They
   stop traveling, talking to others, watching TV, or even going to
   doctors.

   Feeling possessed. People with DPD in some cases report feeling as if
   an evil entity has taken up residence inside their head, watching them
   and making negative comments.

   Acting "as if." People with DPD suffer from not feeling that they are
   acting, but instead they have a strange feeling of "as-if acting." They
   feel that they imitate moods and expressions as if trying to act normal
   around others. But they continue to feel like outsiders who aren't part
   of ordinary life.

   Like many psychopathological signs, depersonalization can linger for
   years, go away, and then return. Some people with depersonalization
   sometimes suffer devastating consequences in their personal and
   professional lives, while others can continue to function fairly well
   while they seek treatment.

   If you think you may have depersonalization, it is crucial to seek out
   a physician you feel attuned to, preferably one who has experience
   treating depersonalization, and in whom you have confidence. There are
   also good informational sites on the web where you can share your
   stories and get support from other DPD survivors. One of my favorites
   is an online community hosted by the aforementioned author Jeffrey
   Abugel.

Stranger vs Foreigner vs Alien vs Outlander vs Outsider vs Immigrant vs
Émigré

   December 11, 2020December 11, 2020 admin Synonyms

   Stranger, foreigner, alien, outlander, outsider, immigrant, émigré can
   all designate a person who comes into a community from the outside and
   is not recognized as a member of that community.

   This is the primary denotation of some of the words, but the secondary
   sense of the others, especially the last three. Stranger and foreigner
   may both apply to one who comes from another country or sometimes from
   another section as a resident or visitor.

   [INS: :INS]

   They have somewhat different implications, however, stranger stressing
   the person's unfamiliarity with the language and customs and foreigner
   the fact that he speaks a different language, follows different
   customs, or bears allegiance to another government.

   Alien emphasizes allegiance to another sovereign or government and is
   often opposed to citizen ; thus, one may be called a foreigner after
   naturalization, but not with accuracy an alien . In extended use alien
   can imply either exclusion from full privileges of or inability to
   identify oneself with a group.

   Outlander , in its general sense, is preferred to foreigner only for a
   literary or rhetorical reason or because it carries the implications
   of outlandish .

   Outsider usually implies nonmembership in a group, clique, or caste
   largely because of essential differences in origin, interests,
   backgrounds, customs, and manners.

   Immigrant and émigré are often used of foreigners who are residents and
   no longer aliens.

   Immigrant usually is applied to a foreigner who has come voluntarily,
   typically in search of a better means of earning a living or a more
   satisfying way of life; émigré implies that the foreigner is a fugitive
   or refugee from his native land or, in a weaker sense, that he has left
   his abiding place rather from dissatisfaction than from strong hope for
   a better future.

   An 82-year-old Walmart worker, who had just $50 in her bank account and
   moves around with a cane, was gifted more than $130,000 from
   kind-hearted strangers.

   Carman Kelly, 82, of Arizona, has worked at the Apache Junction Walmart
   for a little over two years to help fund her hefty medical bills.

   'Well, I was in the emergency room a few times and I ran out of money,'
   she told News 12, laughing. 'My life has been up and down, up and down.
   They say these are the golden years, but what's golden about them?'

   'My Walmart money, it helped me pay for food and gas and other things,'
   she told Good Morning America (GMA).

   Carman's world got a lot more golden after she met Liz Rizzo, who was
   shopping at the store and noticed the Walmart greeter was leaning on a
   shopping cart with a cane in the basket.

   'When I saw her when I walked in the door, my heart just cracked open,'
   Liz told the news outlet. 'The seniors in the world need to be taken
   care of because they took care of us.'

   In the TikTok, which has been viewed 15.5million times, Liz asked the
   friendly Walmart associate if she 'needed to work here.'

   Carman sadly answered: 'Yeah.' And when asked why Walmart didn't
   provide her with a chair, she told Liz: 'No need, I have this,'
   indicating to her shopping cart.

   According to several employees Liz talked to, the company's policy
   states employees cannot sit throughout their shifts.

   However, Walmart said in a statement to AZ Family that it 'honors
   reasonable accommodations' and has a 'long history of working with
   associates with disabilities.'

   Liz started a GoFundMe for Carman, setting the goal at $10,000 - the
   total amount of her medical bills - which they originally thought would
   never be met. But much to Carman and Liz's surprise, the fundraiser has
   raised more than $133,000 in two weeks.

   When she started the fundraiser for Carman, she had no idea the older
   woman had only $50 in her bank account, which she said would 'last her
   until next week.'

   Now, the $133,000 will go into a trust, according to Liz, to make sure
   the money goes directly to Carman. The 82-year-old and her family are
   also working with a financial advisor to help deal with the large sum
   of money.

     THE POWER OF PEOPLE❤️
     Liz Rizzo didn't know Carman Kelly, the 82yo Walmart greeter who
     donned a cane &amp; a smile as she walked in.
     But Liz couldn't help but wonder why was Carman still working?

   Carman is 'hoping' to retire after receiving the money, which she is
   expected to receive before the new year, and called Liz her 'guardian
   angel'

   Carman is expected to receive the money before the new year.

   In an update video, Carman thanked the strangers who helped her and
   said she 'hoped' to retire after using the money to pay off her medical
   bills.

   'My life is going to change so much,' Carman told News 12. 'It is a
   miracle. I can't thank you enough,' she told Liz, who she calls her
   'guardian angel.'

   'I mean, she was a total stranger to me and it's like God sent her to
   me. And I really feel that way because she has been absolutely
   wonderful,' she told GMA.

   'This will be the golden years for me!' she told News 12 with a bright
   smile on her face.

   Carman plans on moving out of her current home and going into assisted
   living to help her when she falls after she receives the money.

   As for Liz, she's still shocked by how far her TikTok reached and is
   now encouraging others to 'be kind.'

   'My main purpose in this whole thing is to inspire others to do what
   I've done,' she told GMA. 'Just go out and help someone. You don't have
   to do a fundraiser. You can do anything.'

   a 97-year-old veteran in West Vancouver.North Shore News

   A woman who randomly punched a 97-year-old war veteran near West
   Vancouver's Centennial Seawalk, breaking the man’s glasses and causing
   cuts to his face, will be released from jail after spending over four
   months in custody.

   Saima Qamar, 53, was sentenced to time already served on Friday (Oct.
   14) after being found guilty by Judge Diana Dorey of assaulting the
   elderly man in a stranger attack near the Seawalk on May 23.

   Dorey said she was releasing Qamar because she had already served more
   than the 90-day jail sentence she would normally have imposed in the
   case.

   In doing so, however, the judge expressed concerns that Qamar is likely
   suffering from mental illness and still poses a risk to reoffend given
   her refusal to take part in a psychiatric evaluation.

Unprovoked stranger attack

   Crown counsel Mark Slay described the attack as an unprovoked and
   “brutal assault” on then-97-year-old Joseph McCaig, as he was returning
   from grocery shopping on his electric scooter along Bellevue Avenue.

   In court Thursday, McCaig, now 98, told the judge, as he approached the
   busy intersection of Bellevue and 17th Street he saw a woman sitting in
   a chair, “calling out things I didn’t understand.”

   He was partway across the crosswalk when “I was struck by a blow of
   some kind,” said McCaig. “My glasses were knocked to the ground.”

   McCaig said he saw a woman he identified as Qamar nearby, holding
   something in her hand. Bystanders rushed over to help him.

   Police arrived soon after and found McCaig bleeding from his head.

   Officers who testifed in court said they found Qamar nearby, speaking
   in “incoherent sentences,” said the judge. They arrested her and took
   her back to cells, where she remained “argumentative and difficult.”

   In a victim impact statement, McCaig said he was unable to take part in
   his usual activities for several months after the attack because he
   didn’t have a good pair of glasses. Veterans Affairs wouldn’t cover the
   cost of a new pair, he said, and he had to pay for an eye exam and an
   inferior pair of glasses at a cost of over $455.

   It’s the second stranger attack Qamar has been convicted of in West
   Vancouver.

Accused threw hot coffee at library staffer

   Earlier this month, on Oct. 4, she was also found guilty of assaulting
   a staff member at the West Vancouver Memorial Library by throwing a hot
   cup of coffee on the woman on Dec. 5, 2019.

   In that case, a young woman was studying with friends at the library
   when Qamar – who she didn’t know - began to verbally harass her, making
   comments about her clothing, including, “How did your family let you
   out like that? This is not a swimming pool. Have you forgotten to put
   on clothes?”

   The woman told Qamar, “This is a free country and I can dress however I
   want,” she testified. She then left the area of the coffee shop.

   A library staff member approached Qamar, telling her, “She needed to be
   respectful.”

   “That’s when she threw the coffee at me,” the staffer testified in
   court. The hot coffee left her with first-degree burns, she said.

   Judge Susan Sangha said a jail sentence of 14 days would have been
   appropriate in that case but sentenced her to time served and 12
   months’ probation, with terms to take counselling as directed by her
   probation office. Qamar was also ordered to stay away from the West
   Vancouver library and the 1700 block of Marine Drive and Bellevue
   Avenue in West Vancouver.

Undiagnosed mental health issues

   Throughout both court hearings, both the prosecutor and judges
   struggled with how to deal with what they described as Qamar’s apparent
   but undiagnosed mental health problems.

   Qamar refused assistance from a lawyer, refused to testify and refused
   to provide any background information about herself.

   She often talked and laughed to herself in the prisoner’s dock, causing
   Dorey to warn her several times about her “unacceptable” behaviour in
   court.

   The prosecutor told the judge Qamar had refused to take part in
   psychiatric evaluations on five separate occasions while in custody.

   Slay told the judge he had spoken with Qamar’s sister in the U.S., a
   medical doctor, who was very concerned and said Qamar had been
   exhibiting signs of undiagnosed schizophrenia for about 10 years. Qamar
   is well-educated and trained as an orthodontist in New York, Slay told
   the court. The sister said in the past she had cared for Qamar in the
   U.S., but Qamar’s behaviour in public resulted in her being deported
   back to Canada, he said.

   A doctor at the forensic psychiatric hospital where Qamar spent some of
   her time in custody said Qamar was not exhibiting signs of psychosis at
   that time, although he added she may have been “between episodes,” said
   Slay.

   The judge said, however, there was little point in ordering a
   psychiatric evaluation when Qamar had made it clear she would refuse to
   take part.

   In sentencing Qamar to time already served, Dorey urged her to take
   advantage of the counselling and medical assistance being offered.

   “You have a life ahead of you. You need to get some help,” she told
   Qamar. “The public is at risk if you can’t control your behaviour.”

   STRANGERS TO OURSELVES
   Unsettled Minds and the Stories That Make Us
   By Rachel Aviv
   276 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $28.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Rachel Aviv was 6 years old when she was hospitalized for not eating.
   She was so young that she had never encountered the word “anorexia”
   before; it sounded to her like a kind of dinosaur.

   Her doctors decided that she should be kept with the older girls with
   eating disorders, who taught her how to exercise obsessively and
   treated her like an “anorexic-in-training.” But Aviv soon started
   eating again and quickly lost interest in depriving herself of the food
   she had previously refused even to talk about (pronouncing the words
   had felt the same to her as consuming them). A year later, she would
   confide in her diary, “I had some thing that was a siknis its cald
   anexorea.” She explained that she had anorexia “because I want to be
   someone better than me.”

   It’s a startling passage in the prologue of “Strangers to Ourselves,”
   but like so many of the stories in this intimate and revelatory book,
   the truth of it is real but incomplete. As an adult, having written a
   number of stories about people in extremis for The New Yorker, Aviv has
   come to “question whatever basic feelings existed in me before they
   were called anorexia.” Her medical records failed to present a
   “coherent picture” of why she stopped eating and drinking, but that
   didn’t stop the doctors from issuing diagnostic proclamations. “The
   original experience couldn’t be captured or understood on its own
   terms,” she writes, “and gradually became something that wasn’t
   entirely of our own making.”

   By “our” Aviv is referring to the other people in her book. There’s
   Ray, who sued an elite psychiatric hospital that prided itself on its
   psychoanalytic approach for failing to make him better; Bapu, a wealthy
   Brahmin mother of two who repeatedly left her family in Chennai, India,
   to pursue the ascetic life of a mystic; Naomi, who was incarcerated for
   second-degree murder after throwing herself and her twin babies into
   the Mississippi River; and Laura, a Harvard graduate from a well-to-do
   family, who had been prescribed psychiatric medications since she was a
   teenager and decided — years later — to see who she was without the
   drugs.

   We learn about these people one by one, with a chapter for each, so
   that Aviv can recount their lives in detail and therefore in full. She
   interviews doctors, friends and survivors; she reads her subjects’
   journals in order to get a grasp on how they explained themselves to
   themselves. Aside from her candid reflections in the prologue and the
   epilogue, Aviv mostly hangs back, even though her own experience primes
   us — as maybe it primed her — to be alert to how stories can clarify as
   well as distort the mental distress that a person is going through.

   Psychiatric explanations can be helpful and harmful, Aviv says. They
   pretend to a neutrality that can offer consolation but also
   condescension. Persistent colonial assumptions about the irrationality
   of Indian religions meant that some of Bapu’s doctors were disdainfully
   dismissive. “She was ugly,” one tells Aviv. “She was living like a
   witch, and looking like a witch.”

   In Naomi’s case, medications helped with her psychosis, but psychiatric
   evaluations were also used against her. Naomi, who is Black, said that
   she had dropped her babies into the river in order to save them from a
   life of “inferiority, indifference and ridicule” in a racist society.
   The psychiatrists who first evaluated Naomi after her arrest decided
   that even though she talked about an impending apocalypse and living in
   another dimension, her remarks about racism were too astute for her to
   meet the legal bar for insanity. But as her release date approached, 13
   years later, a psychiatrist concluded that she had not yet “achieved
   adequate stability”: “Now she was deemed unwell enough to be
   indefinitely detained,” Aviv writes.

   Aviv’s narrative is so attuned to subtlety and complexity that any
   summary risks making it sound like she’s doing something she’s not.
   This isn’t an anti-psychiatry book — Aviv is too aware of the specifics
   of any situation to succumb to anything so sweeping and polemical. What
   she does is recognize the multiplicity of stories that attach to her
   subjects’ experiences, exploring a variety of interpretations instead
   of jumping at the impulse to explain them away.

   “Strangers to Ourselves” delicately balances two truths that prove
   remarkably difficult to hold in tandem. We all have our own minds, our
   own experiences, our own suffering; we are also social creatures who
   live among others, and social forces have at least some bearing on how
   we understand who we are. Aviv suggests that we continue to cling to
   reductive theories about brain chemistry because “the reality — that
   mental illness is caused by an interplay between biological, genetic,
   psychological and environmental factors — is more difficult to
   conceptualize.”

   Psychiatrists talk a lot about “insight,” or what one defined as “the
   correct attitude to a morbid change in oneself.” Aviv points out the
   professional presumption baked into the term, as if insight is supposed
   to measure “the degree to which a patient agrees with his or her
   doctor’s interpretation.” Aviv, for her part, finds more resonance in
   Keats’s notion of “negative capability” — the capacity to experience
   “uncertainty, mysteries and doubts, without any irritable reaching
   after facts or reason.” She admits how hard it is for her to sustain
   such patience for her own anxieties and preoccupations, but “Strangers
   to Ourselves” is a book-length demonstration of Aviv’s extraordinary
   ability to hold space for the “uncertainty, mysteries and doubts” of
   others.

   Looking back on her hospitalization three decades ago, Aviv remains
   haunted by what happened to another girl in the ward, named Hava, who
   died in her early 40s from complications of bulimia. In her journals,
   the 12-year-old Hava showed plenty of insight about her condition,
   referring frequently to her “chemical imbalances,” whereas the
   6-year-old Aviv “had basically none.”

   But perhaps it was this lack of insight — “I never felt stuck in a
   particular story that others had created for me” — that made Aviv’s
   diagnosis feel more malleable to her, allowing her to pursue other
   possibilities. The divide between her fate and Hava’s was enormous but
   also porous. “There are stories that save us, and stories that trap
   us,” Aviv writes, “and in the midst of an illness it can be very hard
   to know which is which.”

   Ok, I know this is a dumb question, but since I'm not a native english
   speaker, I've been wondering about it for a while. haha

   I've never seen a sentence using the word Stranger to define things. I
   did see it to define a person you do not know, but not for things.

   So, my question is: In this title, "Stranger Things", does it mean that
   these things that are happening, are more strange than the "normal"
   strange? (Does it make sense at all?)

   Like, this is strange, but thattt, oh boy, that's STRANGER!

   I'll appreciate any help to clarify this stupid question of mine.

       The use is stranger as a comparative. There are strange things, and
       then there are stranger things.

     * "Stranger than fiction" is a common phrase.

       Why is something only the show creators would know; captaingabbeh
       has provided that answer. There is also a play on words; the saying
       stranger things have happened refers to events, whereas the show
       includes stranger things which are very much physical.

       Nov 3, 2017 at 19:53
     * Because they wanted the show to be stranger than all the other
       shows on TV.

       Another possible reason: "stranger" is of course also a noun
       referring to an unknown person, so they might have used that to
       subtly suggest the show being about "strangers", like Eleven

   Apparently the showmakers picked it because it sounds similar to a
   Stephen King book called "Needful Things"

   https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-stranger-things-the-duffer-bros-on
   -how-they-made-the-tv-hit-of-the-summer

   (Look for the question "I’m not sure if you guys have ever talked about
   this before, but how did you settle on the title Stranger Things? I
   know originally it was Montauk.")

   I actually thought it was a play on the English saying "Stranger things
   have happened", which is something you would say if you were discussing
   an event that was possible but unlikely. For example, if my friend and
   I are talking about the weather and my friend suggests it will snow in
   August, I might say something like "Well, I guess stranger things have
   happened" to show I don't really think it's going to happen.

   Opposite Of Stranger, Antonyms of Stranger, Meaning and Example
   Sentences
   [INS: :INS]

   [INS: :INS]

   Antonym opposite words contradict each other and meet opposite
   meanings. A word has synonyms as well as antonyms. When we learn a
   language, when we learn a word in that language, it will be very useful
   for us to learn both the opposite and the synonyms of this word.

   Because learning a word with its synonyms increases our competence in
   that language as well as our competence in speaking and writing.
   Learning a word with its opposite meanings both broadens our vocabulary
   and helps our activity on language. There are some things we need to
   know about opposite words.

   First, the negative of a word cannot be the opposite of that
   word. Negative words indicate whether an action should be taken to us,
   that is, not the opposite meaning of a word. In a language, not every
   word has a synonym, but not every word has an opposite. In general,
   adjectives and adverbs have opposite meanings, that is, words reporting
   quality and quantity often have opposite words.

   Stranger means; alien, foreigner, outsider, unknown, gringo

11 Things Well-Meaning Strangers Need To Stop Doing When It Comes To Other
People's Kids


   by Jamie Kenney
   Aug. 9, 2016

   I'll admit that my life is pretty precariously balanced right now. It's
   not that I need to set plans in stone but, as a mom, I thrive on
   routine. On Mondays, for example, we go grocery shopping. Still, all
   the planning in the world doesn't keep me from being tested literally
   every single week, not by the chore, not by my children, but by
   well-meaning strangers who consistently manage to throw off our groove.
   It's not just the grocery store, either: everywhere, sweet people, who
   only want to help, just need to, well, not. There are so many things
   well-meaning strangers need to stop when it comes to kids.

   People have a lot of feels when it comes to kids and, believe me, I get
   it. Like, if this entire topic could have a caveat/thesis statement it
   would be, "I get it." I'm a natural extrovert, I adore children, and I
   feel like I have a good rapport with most kids I encounter. I know the
   instincts of well-meaning strangers because, more often than not, they
   are my instincts, too. However, there are times we must fight our
   natural inclinations in order to accommodate other people's feelings
   and plans, because the road to "parent hell" is paved with good
   intentions from kind strangers.

   You've probably heard the famous Wendy Mass quote (or more likely, seen
   it on your favorite social media feed) that states, "Be kind, for
   everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about." This
   goes, like, triple for parents. Balancing a child's wants, needs,
   triggers, and everything in between is a full-time job in and of
   itself, without all the other crap one has to deal with as an adult
   with. You waltzing into my life, stranger, with your own aims and
   agendas (and even if you think they are compatible with mine) is likely
   to cause issues and screw up a good chunk of my day (or at least my
   hour, which can feel like a day in parenting time).

   And so, with this in mind please, just, don't do the following. Please.

Give Kids Food Without Asking

   Whether my kid looked up at you with pleading puppy dog eyes after
   seeing you reach into your purse for a hard candy, or you just know the
   little tyke would love some, please do not give food to a child without
   consulting that child's parent first. You don't know what religious
   dietary restrictions, allergies, family rules, or meal schedules you
   might be messing with, and the consequences of even the most
   well-meaning "treat" run the gamut between annoying and inconvenient to
   deadly.

Ask A Parent, Within A Kid's Range Of Hearing, If They Want A Treat

   I don't mean to nitpick here, because I do appreciate when people eager
   to do something nice for my little ones, consult me first. However, if
   that consultation is a loudly asked, "Would they like lollipops?" it's
   anything but helpful. All kids need to hear is "lollipop" to know that
   they now need one. With sweet, sugary goodness hanging in the balance,
   my children will harangue me until I say yes.

   So, when this specific instance takes place, I now have two choices:
   give in even if I'd rather they not have the lollipop to avoid option
   two, which is a downward spiral of child emotions. Now, I am willing
   and capable of either, depending on my mood and the day, but I'd rather
   not do either. So please, if you want to give my kid a treat of some
   kind, ask me in a way that they cannot hear or understand. You'd really
   be doing me a solid and you'll potentially avoid upsetting them.

Try To Engage A Clearly Emotional Kid

   Question: You see a child sobbing in the middle of a public space. Do
   you...

   A) Give obvious, judgmental, obnoxious side-eye.

   B) Offer the parent a silent, sympathetic look but simply move on

   C) Start talking to the child in an attempt to make them feel better

   If you answered A), this is a jerk move and I wish you'd stop, because
   you probably have no idea what's actually going on. However, sure, I
   can deal with your judgment because it's more a reflection on you than
   me. If you answered B) thank you very much, this is probably the best
   move. If you answered C), I may or may not (but definitely did) let out
   a sigh. This is so, so common and I get the good-natured impulse many
   people feel to try and help, especially from other parents. However, I
   would seriously pay an annual fee every year until my kid hits
   adulthood to never have to deal with this again.

   Think about it this way: if you were really emotional, would a very
   tall stranger approaching you, asking what was wrong and encouraging
   you not to cry, make you feel better? No. It would probably freak you
   out and you're an adult with the ability to process social interactions
   way better than a child. It sucks because I know people who do this are
   trying to be really nice, but they are only prolonging my child's
   crying jag/tantrum/whatever is going on because they're anxious about
   some random person getting all up in their grill.

Help A Kid When You See That Their Parent Is Watching

   I'm not saying you should never help a child. All too often I've been
   occupied with one child at the playground while another needed my help
   and a cool parent has stepped up to lend a hand. Perhaps they've helped
   my kid onto a swing or down from the jungle gym. I try to help out busy
   parents as well, to repay the universe for sending me good karma when I
   need it. This is just good citizenship. Having said that, there are
   other times when I am trying to get my 4-year-old or my 2-year-old to
   learn how to do something on their own. Like, I'm watching them, I've
   encouraged them, and then someone else comes along and says "Oh here,
   let me."

   I was right here! There's a reason I was letting them work it out
   without adult intervention. Now I just look like a big jerk and my kid
   is no closer to learning how to use the monkey bars.

Touch Someone Else's Kid

   The people who tend to do this the most in my life are self proclaimed
   "old teachers" and grandmothers. Look, I get it: kids are adorable and
   every now and then you want to sniff their heads or pinch their chubby
   legs or give them hugs. However, it's kinda weird and I wish you
   wouldn't. Like, ever.

   For one, I don't want my kid to be under the impression that strangers
   are allowed to touch them, because they're not. For another, my kid
   doesn't exist to feed your need to love something. My kid doesn't exist
   to feed my need to love something, and I made my kid and birthed my kid
   and I'm currently raising my kid! So please, don't hug someone else's
   baby. Just be cool and, perhaps, the opportunity will occur naturally
   over time.

Give Child Permission For Something

   If you don't know a kid, or if you only tangentially know a kid, you do
   not have the authority to tell them what they're allowed to do. Even if
   it's, like, let them play in your yard or take something you're
   offering, because the parent will have (and should have) the final say.
   I know you mean well, and you're probably just signaling to the parent,
   "Oh, it's OK, I don't mind," but you're not thinking about the fact
   that, for whatever reasons, the parents do mind.

Second Guess Someone Else's Parenting

   Obviously no two people are going to parent exactly alike. The best
   thing to do when you see a parent making a different decision than you
   probably would, is to revisit the old adage "mother/father knows best."
   This is especially true when you don't know the person in question.
   Seriously, just don't say anything, particularly not to my kids, as it
   will be both passive aggressive and undermining (plus it puts kids in
   the middle of an adult disagreement, which is just not good for anyone
   involved).

Go On About How Pretty Someone's Daughter Is

   This sounds obnoxious (who doesn't like a compliment), but hear me out.

   It's sweet that you pay my kid a compliment and, yeah, I think she's
   very pretty, too. However, when strangers constantly comment on her
   looks (and just her looks) that's sending a few messages I'd rather she
   not receive:

   "Your primary value lies in your appearance."

   "The best way to positive attention is via your looks."

   I'll also add that people do not compliment my (equally pretty, I
   think) son in the same way. He usually gets, "You're getting so big"
   or, "That's a cool toy you've got there."

   What happens as my little girl gets older and doesn't have that same
   level of baby cuteness anymore? All of a sudden, all those people who
   were telling her how "precious" she was aren't there praising her
   anymore. It's a bummer.

   This is a general plea to strangers: pay attention to how you're
   engaging little kids. All the random little comments they get from
   individual strangers have a cumulative effect.

Discipline Someone's Kid Without Expressed Permission

   Unless there's an emergency situation where my kid is actively harming
   or about to harm you, your child, or themselves (and I'm not there),
   please just let me handle it. Not your kid, not your business.

Insist To Someone's Kid That What You're Doing Is OK Because "I'm Nice"/"I'm
Your Friend"

   When I word it that way you can probably see why I'm against it, right?
   I mean, it sounds really creepy and predatory even when it isn't.
   However, I'm aware that in the moment, sometimes, people don't
   necessarily get that in their attempt to win a smile from a child, they
   sound, um, "untoward."

   Insisting that there is a level of intimacy between two strangers that
   does not actually exist because the adult in question wants to create a
   pleasant interaction, is just uncalled for and sets some potentially
   dangerous precedents for a child who is probably just working of a
   natural (and healthy) dose of stranger-danger.

Keep Trying To Win A Kid Over When It Just Isn't Happening

   I cannot stress enough how I understand this particular situation,
   because I feel like I have probably done this with kittens or puppies
   in the past. In the end you just want to express your squealing delight
   in the adorableness of this sweet, tiny little creature that you wind
   up trying way too hard, even after when that tiny creature has given
   you all the signs that they're just not that into you.

   However, just let it go. You're not going to win over the kid in the
   minimal amount of time you have, and your attempts are just sort of
   holding up the parent from whatever it is they're out and attempting to
   do. (And now they're having to do it with an increasingly agitated
   child in tow.) There will be other chances to talk to (more amenable)
   little kids and get a smile out of them.

Mysterious reflections on Mars might come from something stranger than water

   By Elizabeth Rayne
   last updated 6 October 2022

   Scientists hoped it was a lake under the ice, but it may just be a
   mirage.

   Scientists revisiting a mysterious signal from the south pole of Mars
   have suggested a new potential explanation, and it doesn't bode well
   for hopes of finding liquid water on the Red Planet.

   In 2018, scientists using data from the European Space Agency's Mars
   Express orbiter's Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere
   Sounding (MARSIS) instrument announced that they'd observed a radar
   signal that could be interpreted as evidence of liquid water. That
   signal, a strange bright reflection, came from the Martian south pole
   in a region known as Ultima Scopuli. Researchers investigating the
   reflection now suggest that the signal didn't come from the ice itself,
   or even from liquid water, but from underlying geological layers made
   of minerals and frozen carbon dioxide. In particular, it turned out
   that the thickness of these layers, rather than what they're made of,
   creates the otherworldly reflection.

   On Earth, dazzling reflections like this often come from liquid water.
   For example, subglacial lakes like Antarctica's Lake Vostok, which has
   been lying under more than 2 miles (3 kilometers) of ice for millions
   of years, causes a bright radar signal like that found on Mars.
   However, just because it's possible for something like this to have
   also occurred on Mars doesn't guarantee the presence of liquid water.

   Related: These dry ice glaciers on Mars are moving at its south pole

   The research team used radar data from MARSIS, along with computer
   simulations, to investigate this mystery. The scientists simulated
   layers of ice and other substances, like basalt rock that formed after
   ancient volcanic eruptions on Mars, to see how these materials  would
   react to incoming light.

   Because there is an immense amount of carbon dioxide frozen in the
   Martian south pole, Cornell University planetary scientist and lead
   author of the research Dan Lalich was sure to include layers of this
   ice in the simulations. And one simulation in particular, with a layer
   of carbon dioxide ice and below the water ice, revealed that the
   separation and thickness of layers determined the strength of a
   reflection.

   Previous studies Lalich worked on also found that certain minerals
   could also conjure a reflection like this. He believes that even layers
   of the Red Planet's dust-obscured ice are capable of it. Either way, no
   liquid water is necessary to create the reflection.

   "I could have used rock layers or even particularly dusty water ice and
   I would have gotten similar results," he said in a statement. "The
   point of this paper is really that the composition of the basal layers
   is less important than the layer thicknesses and separations."

   The new research doesn't mean that there is no chance of liquid water
   existing somewhere on Mars, however.

   "None of the work we’ve done disproves the possible existence of liquid
   water down there," Lalich said. "We just think the interference
   hypothesis is more consistent with other observations. I'm not sure
   anything short of a drill could prove either side of this debate
   definitively right or wrong."

   Whether under a glacier or deep beneath the planet's scorched reddish
   surface, water — and possibly traces of life or — may still be lurking
   somewhere.

   The research is described in a paper published Sept. 28 in Nature
   Astronomy (opens in new tab).

TikTok runner goes viral documenting a stranger following her

   Samantha MacIntyre was documenting her journey to running a half
   marathon when her normal run took a scary turn.

Woman documents scary moments of being followed while running

   / Source: TODAY
   By Anna Kaplan

   What started as a normal 8-mile run for Samantha MacIntyre turned into
   a scary situation that many women are familiar with.

   The Idaho runner, who documents her journey preparing for a half
   marathon on the TikTok account @sageandmaize, was filming a running
   vlog earlier this month when she said she noticed a man driving a red
   truck pass by her.

   IFRAME: //iframe.nbcnews.com/fv3rYw7?_showcaption=true&amp;app=1

   "The first time that he drove by me, he had his whole top half of his
   body out the window, looking back at me multiple times, and it kind of
   slowed down," MacIntyre told TODAY.

   MacIntyre, 24, documented the entire experience in a TikTok, which now
   has more than 8.8 million views.

   In the TikTok, she initially wasn't sure if she was just "being
   paranoid." But as the truck kept passing by her she became "really
   nervous," leading her to stop her run early.

   "When I saw him drive by the second time doing the same thing, I just
   got this really bad gut feeling and I was like, something’s wrong," she
   told TODAY.

   In the TikTok, MacIntyre explained she had to run by the truck to get
   back to her own car. "Alright I see the car parked up here, I do not
   feel good about this. I don't know what to do," she said.

   "It's just one of those things where it's like, you don't think it's
   going to happen to you, until it happens to you," she continued. "I
   don't want to risk anything — I gotta have my parents come pick me up."

   MacIntyre called her parents and the police, and ran to a nearby house
   for safety. The police department confirmed to TODAY they found the man
   in question, but no charges were filed.

   MacIntyre's TikTok comes weeks after 34-year-old Eliza Fletcher was
   abducted and killed while on her regular morning jog in Memphis,
   Tennessee earlier this month.

   "It really spooked me because as a fellow runner, I’m like oh my gosh,
   this could possibly happen to me," she said of Fletcher's death.

   The runner said she now runs with an alarm, mace and a whistle, and
   that she didn't let the experience stop her from running her first half
   marathon.

   "It was a really big accomplishment that I even got myself to do that
   half marathon because I really thought that I might not ever run
   again," MacIntyre said.

   MacIntyre added she will now stick to indoor tracks, and if she does
   take up outdoor running again, she'll be carrying protection with her.

Bipartisan bill would end ‘stranger loophole’ for restraining orders

   A bipartisan set of New Jersey lawmakers want to expand state law to
   allow stalking victims to get restraining orders against their
   harassers, even if they’re being stalked by a stranger.

   Restraining orders are meant to protect victims of domestic violence
   cases. They are civil orders and do not require criminal charges to be
   filed against the defendant, though such charges often accompany
   restraining orders.

   Under state statute, the only times restraining orders can be issued
   without a conviction are in domestic violence cases — meaning they can
   bar a family member or one-time significant other from contacting the
   victim — or in stalking cases involving minors or adults who cannot
   provide consent because of a disorder.

   While the individual provisions of a given order vary depending on the
   case, they can bar a defendant from contacting the victim and their
   friends or family members, block them from entering the victim’s home
   or place of work, and allow police to seize firearms belonging to the
   defendant, among other things.

   Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said he signed on as a co-sponsor after
   hearing from the family of a 27-year-old woman who, after receiving
   strange and threatening messages at all hours from a man she had never
   dated, was unable to get a restraining order against her stalker.

   “Long story short, she goes to the police station, the police say,
   ‘Well, you can’t get a restraining order. You’ve got to file criminal
   charges,’” Bramnick said. “Meanwhile, the police don’t do it, so you
   have to do it yourself.”

   The woman has since filed criminal charges, but the stalker is free to
   contact her while the trial is ongoing, the senator said.

   It’s possible for an adult stalking victim to get a restraining order
   against a stranger, but they must wait for their stalker to be
   convicted on related charges, such as harassment.

   “The sort of loophole here is where a conviction hasn’t taken place,
   and it’s also a stranger, so I think this would be an excellent
   addition to that body of law,” said Sen. Linda Greenstein
   (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime sponsor.

   Alleged stalkers might be barred from contacting the victim by a
   separate judicial order — like a no-contact order, for instance — but
   breaching such accords doesn’t always carry the immediate criminal
   penalties attached to restraining order violations.

   If a defendant violates the restraints set by an order, they’re likely
   to face criminal contempt charges, which can carry a prison term of up
   to 18 months.

   The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which may
   meet to confirm judges during legislators’ customary summer recess.
   That leaves a chance the bill could advance before lawmakers return to
   Trenton in earnest come September.
