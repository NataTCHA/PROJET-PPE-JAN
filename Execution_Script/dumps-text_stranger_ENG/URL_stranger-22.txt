5 Ways To Help A Stranger

   When was the last time you stopped to help a stranger? Every time you
   leave your home you are bound to encounter a stranger. And you are
   likely to encounter a stranger that needs your help.

   Here are five simple ways you can help a stranger by showing kindness:

   1. Smile- A simple smile can brighten someone's day and turn a crummy
   day around.

   2. Pass up a close parking spot- I have recently started passing up
   parking spots so someone else can park close. I often hope this will
   help an expectant mother, an elderly person or someone with small
   children. Plus, I can always use the exercise!

   3. Leave a BIG tip- My husband and I dine out once a week and I'm
   always appreciative of the pleasant and attentive wait staff. This is a
   difficult job and sometimes I like to leave a BIG tip as I figure a
   little extra money never hurt anyone. You never know what difference
   $10, $20 or more could make in a person's life.

   4. Hold a door- I know this one sounds simple but I can't tell you how
   many times I've had a door whack me in the face because the person in
   front of me opened the door and just kept moving. Especially holding
   doors for parents with children/strollers, those in
   wheelchairs/scooters and people with their arms full. I always love to
   see someone approaching a door and I wait to hold it open for them.
   They usually get a little hop in their step, smile and say, 'Thanks so
   much!' I also make sure when children hold the door open for me I show
   appreciation and let them know it was a kind gesture.

   5. Stop and look around- In 2011 I started a giving journey. A mission
   to give a gift every day. The biggest thing the journey taught me is
   that we are busy. We are all moving very fast and have blinders on most
   of the time. I think one of the best ways for all of us to help each
   other out is to slow down and look around. I'm amazed at the need all
   around if I just stop and look for it. I guarantee when you look you,
   will recognize how you are to help out a stranger.

   I always love to end with a challenge, so the next time you encounter a
   stranger needing help, lend a hand and share your story with us. I'd
   also appreciate it if you would share this blog with friends and
   family. They may just need an idea on how to help a stranger.
