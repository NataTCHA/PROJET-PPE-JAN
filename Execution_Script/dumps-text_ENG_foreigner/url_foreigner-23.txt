   By The Irrawaddy 19 October 2022

   Myanmar’s military regime has arrested six foreigners since the
   military coup last year, including a former British ambassador to the
   country. The six were arrested for having connections to the ousted
   National League for Democracy (NLD) government or journalists covering
   anti-regime protests, among others. Only three have been released while
   the rest remain in junta jails. The following is a complete list of who
   they are, when and where they were arrested, and for what.
    1. Australian economist Sean Turnell

   Australian economist Sean Turnell had worked as an economic advisor to
   Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) government
   since 2017. He was the first foreigner to be detained after the coup
   because of his ties to the NLD government. He was arrested at a hotel
   in Yangon, one week after Feb. 1 2021 coup.

   A junta-controlled court in Naypyitaw Prison sentenced him to three
   years in prison on September 29 for violating the Official Secrets Act
   and visa regulations.

   Australia’s government rejected the ruling and called for Turnell to be
   immediately released. The 58-year-old economist is currently being held
   in Insein Prison in Yangon. He pleaded not guilty to charges against
   him at a court hearing on August 11 this year.
    2. Polish photojournalist Robert Bociaga

   Polish journalist Robert Bociaga was detained by junta security
   personnel while documenting an anti-coup protest in Taunggyi in
   southern Shan State on March 11, 2021.

   The 30-year-old was allegedly beaten during his arrest. He was charged
   under the Immigration Act and fined 200,000 kyats. He was freed on
   March 22 after 11 days of detention at Taung Lay Lone Prison in
   Taunggyi.
    3. Japanese freelance journalist Yuki Kitazumi

   Japanese freelance journalist Yuki Kitazumi was detained in Yangon on
   April 18, 2021. The 45-year-old was charged on May 3 for spreading
   ‘fake news’, but released from Insein Prison on May 14. He returned to
   Japan the same day.

   He was also beaten up and briefly detained while covering an anti-coup
   protest in Yangon on February 26. He was released the same day after
   around five hours in detention.
    4. US journalist Danny Fenster

   American journalist Danny Fenster was detained on May 24 at Yangon
   International Airport on his way back to the US.

   The 37-year-old managing director of the Yangon-based Frontier Myanmar
   news magazine was charged with incitement and breaking the Unlawful
   Association Act and Immigration Act, and given 11 years in prison.

   He was prosecuted partly because he worked for local media outlet
   Myanmar Now, whose media license the regime had revoked after the coup.
   The judge refused to consider the fact that he resigned from Myanmar
   Now on July 2020 and had since been working for Frontier Myanmar.

   He was released after more than five months of detention at Insein
   Prison, following former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson’s
   intervention. He was deported on November 15 and flew to the US.
    5. Japanese documentary filmmaker Toru Kubota

   Japanese documentary filmmaker Toru Kubota was arrested at an anti-coup
   protest on July 30, 2022. He was charged with incitement and violating
   the Immigration Act and Electronic Transactions Law.

   He was handed seven years in prison on October 5 for incitement and
   breaking the electronic transactions law. On October 12, he was
   sentenced to another three years for violating the immigration law.

   The 26-year-old is the second Japanese journalist to be detained since
   the coup, and is currently being held in Insein Prison.
    6. Former British ambassador Vicky Bowman

   Britain’s former ambassador to Myanmar Vicky Bowman, also known as Daw
   Ohmar Khin, and her husband Ko Htein Lin, a renowned artist and former
   political prisoner, were detained on August 24 this year at their house
   in Yangon.

   The regime charged Bowman with breaking immigration laws by staying in
   a family home in Shan State’s Kalaw rather than in her registered
   Yangon address after her husband failed to report his wife’s stay in
   Shan State.

   The couple was imprisoned for one year with hard labor on September 2
   by a junta-controlled court in Insein Prison.

   Bowman served as Britain’s ambassador to Myanmar under the previous
   military regime between 2002 and 2006. She was the first former
   diplomat to be detained after the coup.

   The arrest came after the British government had downgraded its
   relationship with Myanmar’s military regime.
