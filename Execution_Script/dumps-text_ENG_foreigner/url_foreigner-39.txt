   The number of foreigners living in China is very low in international
   comparison and has further declined recently. While the strict
   COVID-19-related travel restrictions played a major role in this
   decline, there are indications that the decline started in part before
   the pandemic and may well continue once the pandemic-related
   restrictions are lifted. Against this background, this article
   discusses the economic challenges that the reduction in the number of
   foreigners is causing for Western multinationals operating in China and
   to the Chinese economy more generally. The consequences could spill
   over to the world economy and reinforce economic and technological
   decoupling tendencies between China and the West.

   According to preliminary results of the 2020 National Census of China,
   there were 845,697 foreigners and an additional 584,998 residents of
   Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan – together 1,430,695 immigrants^1 – living
   in mainland China on 1 November 2020 (NBSC, 2021). This was a
   substantial increase of 410,550 immigrants (40.2%) compared to the
   previous Census of 2010. The increase was greater for foreigners
   (251,865; 42.4%) than for residents of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
   (158,685; 37.2%). Still, the total number of immigrants amounted to
   just 0.1% (and that of foreigners to just 0.06%) of China’s population
   of more than 1.41 billion people.^2 This is an exceptionally low share
   not only compared to Western countries such as the United States
   (15.4%), Germany (15.7%) or France (12.8%) but also compared to China’s
   East Asian neighbours Japan (2.0%) or South Korea (2.3%), or even
   compared to the similarly populous – but economically less developed –
   India (0.4%) (UNDESA, 2022).

   In addition, the overall immigration growth rate of more than 40% from
   2010 to 2020 is the result of very heterogeneous developments across
   Chinese provinces. While the number of immigrants in Yunnan Province in
   South China has increased by about 700% (from 47,396 to 379,281)
   between 2010 and 2020,^3 the number of immigrants has actually
   decreased in several other provinces. This is true, in particular, for
   the municipalities Shanghai and Beijing where the number of immigrants
   has decreased by about 21.4% (from 208,602 to 163,954) and 41.5% (from
   107,445 to 62,812), respectively. And, although the preliminary results
   of the 2020 Census published so far do not provide the numbers of
   foreigners for individual provinces, given the exceptional development
   of the number of immigrants in Yunnan, it can reasonably be assumed
   that the aggregate number of foreigners in the other 30 Chinese
   provinces has actually declined between 2010 and 2020 by roughly 80,000
   persons or about 14.5%, according to a back of the envelope
   estimation.^4

   As the National Census was carried out in late 2020, it has already
   been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the strict travel
   restrictions imposed in response (see below). By this time, an unknown
   number of immigrants had already left China and/or were unable to enter
   or return to China due to these strict travel restrictions. Given that
   foreigners, including expatriates from Western countries, have more
   likely been directly affected by these restrictions than residents from
   Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, these restrictions have certainly
   contributed to the particularly strong decrease in the number of
   immigrants in Beijing and Shanghai, where the number of foreigners has
   been substantially higher than the number of residents from Hong Kong,
   Macao and Taiwan.^5

   Additionally, there is evidence showing that the decade-long increase
   in the number of foreigners living in China had already come to a halt
   or even reversed in China (outside Yunnan) several years before the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Take Shanghai, the most international city in China,
   as an example. While the number of foreigners increased substantially
   from 100,011 in 2005 to 174,192 persons in 2012 (roughly 8% annual
   growth rate); it only increased to 178,335 persons in 2015 (roughly
   0.8% annual growth rate) and then decreased to 172,076 in 2018 (SBS,
   2014-2019). A similar trend reversal can be observed among German
   citizens living in China. According to the 2010 Population Census,
   Germans were the second largest group of Europeans living in China in
   2010 (NBSC, 2012). According to the German Statistical Office, in each
   year from 2001 to 2014, the number of German citizens moving from
   Germany to China exceeded the number of Germans re-migrating from China
   to Germany, resulting in a net migration of 6,325 Germans to China
   between 2001 and 2014 (Destatis, 2022). In contrast, in each year
   between 2015 and 2020, more Germans moved back to Germany from China
   than the other way around, leading to a net remigration of 4,159
   Germans back from China to Germany during this period.

China’s immigration policy

   Given its large population and its developing economic status, China
   does not perceive itself as a potential immigration country.
   Accordingly, the development of China’s immigration policy has been the
   result of a perceived need for China to control and regulate increasing
   immigration flows rather than attempt to actively promote immigration
   or facilitate the integration of immigrants into the Chinese economy
   and society.

   China’s Exit and Entry Administration Law, which was passed in 2012,
   marked an important turning point in China’s immigration policy. Over
   the more than three decades from the beginning of China’s open-door
   policy to the 2012 law, China’s legal and administration framework for
   immigration control and management had been highly fragmented and
   lacked coordination (Zhu and Price, 2013; Pieke, 2014). A large number
   of central and local authorities were involved in entry procedures, and
   the communication and cooperation between them was highly deficient.
   This framework was inadequate to cope with the economic, social and
   security challenges resulting from the surging number of legal and
   illegal immigrants that followed China’s access to the World Trade
   Organization in 2001 (Zhu and Price, 2013). The 2012 law reflected the
   Chinese government’s recognition that China needed a more comprehensive
   regulatory framework for immigration in order to further its national
   development goals. It provides for an immigration policy that strongly
   differentiates the treatment of foreigners by their perceived benefits
   to the Chinese economy. While particularly highly skilled foreigners
   are wanted and welcome given their potential benefits for China’s
   economic development, the entry of illegal or less desirable foreigners
   and their stay in China are to be more strictly controlled and
   countered than before in the interest of national and social security.

   To be sure, China’s strong preference for attracting high-skilled
   immigrants was not first established by the 2012 law. Already in 2004,
   the Measures for the Administration of Examination and Approval of
   Foreigners’ Permanent Residence in China gave preference to foreigners
   whose qualifications meet certain pre-determined criteria. In 2008, the
   Thousand Talents Program was initiated to actively attract highly
   skilled professionals for advanced research, innovation and the
   establishment of high-tech start-ups in China. Since at that time the
   criteria for the so-called preferred high-skill professionals were
   still very high and the policy measures were carried out only
   selectively without comprehensive coordination and supplementary
   hands-on measures, their impact on attracting foreigners, especially
   those without an ethnic Chinese background, were rather limited (Wang,
   2012). Since the 2012 law, the scope of the related policies to attract
   high-skilled foreigners has become broader, reflecting President Xi
   Jinping’s repeated emphasis of the importance of these talents to
   support China’s innovation-driven economic development. The rules and
   regulations related to immigration were further consolidated and
   focused in favour of highly qualified foreigners with the introduction
   of the Permit for Foreigners to Work in China in 2015. This regulation,
   which was implemented nationwide in 2017, formally established a strict
   grading system for foreigners to help China more effectively attract
   international professionals in line with domestic demand.

   Also in 2015, the Chinese authorities started to implement measures to
   ease the visa and residence application procedures and expanded
   immigration services for targeted foreign professionals/high-skilled
   foreign nationals, at first on an experimental basis in a number of
   selected pilot free trade and demonstration zones. In August 2019,
   several of these policies (relating to the facilitation of visas and
   residence permits, including long-term or permanent residence permits
   for specific high-level foreign talent and the establishment of
   immigration service centres) have been implemented nationwide to
   encourage, support and facilitate foreign talent, outstanding young
   foreigners and overseas Chinese to start businesses, invest, innovate,
   study and work in China (Ministry of Public Security, 2019).

   In view of the consolidation of the legal framework and the (selected)
   facilitation of visas and residence approvals, China’s immigration
   policy has become overall more favourable for particularly high-skilled
   foreigners since 2012. By contrast, for most less skilled migrants,
   Chinese immigration policies have become rather more restrictive due to
   stricter enforcement of the restrictive entry and residence regulation
   for this group. At the same time, Chinese public attitudes towards
   foreigners have become more divided, and public resentment towards
   foreigners has been on the rise since about 2015 (Speelman, 2020).
   Against this background, in 2020 the announcement of a public
   consultation on the Regulations Governing the Permanent Residence of
   Foreigners, which is intended to better regulate and also ease
   foreigner’s permanent stay in China, met with strong headwinds and
   harsh criticism from the public. These strong public reactions,
   particularly on social media, even forced the responsible authorities
   to offer public assurance that the regulations will be further
   “improved” and will not be enforced hastily.

COVID-19-based travel restrictions and the decline in the number of
foreigners

   Since March 2020, China has implemented strict travel restrictions to
   deal with the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. The restrictions imposed
   included a drastic reduction in the number of international passenger
   flights in and out of China, broad restrictions on the issuance of
   visas combined with more complex and time-consuming application
   procedures than before, strict vaccination requirements and stringent
   COVID-19 testing and quarantine requirements both prior to and after
   arrival in China. Despite some adaptations in response to the changing
   global pandemic situation, strict travel restrictions have remained in
   place at least until mid-2022 (the time of writing).

   As a consequence, the number of people, and in particular the number of
   foreigners, crossing China’s border decreased dramatically over the
   past two years. The number of border crossings by foreigners decreased
   from 97.7 million in 2019 to 13.2 million in 2020 and to a mere 4.5
   million (-95.4%) in 2021 (NIA, 2020, 2022). In light of these
   developments, the number of foreigners living in China has likely
   further declined since the reference date of the 2020 National Census
   (1 November 2020). And given the continuation of COVID-19-related
   restrictions and the COVID-19 outbreaks and related strict lockdowns
   in, for example, Jilin and Shanghai in spring 2022, it is likely that
   the number of foreigners living in China will decline even further in
   the near future. In a recent survey among foreigners in Shanghai
   conducted during the strict and long lockdown of the municipality in
   April 2022, 85% of the 950 respondents said that the lockdown has made
   them rethink their future in China. Furthermore, 22% and 26%)of
   respondents said they want to leave China as soon as possible or within
   12 months, respectively. Only 15% of respondents still planned to stay
   in China for the long haul (That’s Shanghai Magazine, 2022).

Implications for Western multinationals in China

   The COVID-19-related travel restrictions and the associated decline in
   the number of foreigners in China have had significant negative
   consequences for many Western companies. Business surveys conducted by
   various chambers of commerce in China in 2021 have found that travel
   and entry restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related human
   resource challenges were by then considered to be among the most
   pressing operational business challenges for Western companies active
   in China. British companies in China surveyed in autumn 2021, for
   example, rated “employing foreign staff” the most burdensome challenge
   for doing business in China in 2021. At the time of the survey, 43% of
   the British companies had existing or new foreign employees outside
   China that were unable to enter the Chinese mainland due to
   COVID-19-related problems of booking suitable flights, securing visas
   for themselves or their dependents or because they were unwilling to
   quarantine (British Chamber, 2022).

   The travel and entry restrictions have significantly exacerbated the
   problems many Western companies in China face in attracting and
   retaining foreign talent. Among the European companies surveyed in
   February 2021, more than 60% of respondents ranked “entry restrictions
   into China due to COVID-19” as one of their top three challenges for
   attracting and for retaining international talent in China at that time
   (European Chamber, 2021a). More than three quarters (and almost
   one-third) of American companies in China surveyed in autumn 2021
   considered it a significant challenge for retaining and recruiting
   international talent in China that qualified candidates were unable
   (and unwilling, respectively) to move to China due to the COVID-19
   restrictions (AmCham China, 2021).

   The COVID-19-related travel and entry restrictions have thus led to a
   reduction of the number (shares) of foreign staff employed by Western
   companies in China. For example, in autumn 2021, 23% of British
   companies surveyed reported a net decrease (vs. only 3% reported a net
   increase) in foreign employees over the past year (British Chamber,
   2021). For 2022, 41% of British companies expected that “a significant
   number of foreign employees will leave China indefinitely”, mainly due
   to emotional strain of prolonged separation from friends and family or
   challenging travel requirements and logistics (British Chamber, 2021,
   23). US companies in China reported an even stronger impact of COVID-19
   restrictions on foreign employment. In late March 2022, about 28% of US
   firms surveyed stated that they had reduced their foreign staff in
   China due to COVID-19 restrictions by more than 20% since the beginning
   of the pandemic, and another 13% of firms by between 10% and 20%. About
   44% of companies expected a further loss of foreign staff, if “current
   COVID-19 restrictions remain in place for the next year” (AmCham China
   and AmCham Shanghai, 2022).

   In line with the general decline in the number of foreigners in China,
   the reduction in the number or share of foreign employees in many
   Western companies in China did not just start with the pandemic.
   According to the German Chamber (2021), for example, the average
   percentage of foreign employees in German companies in China had been
   declining well before the outbreak of the pandemic, decreasing from
   7.1% in 2016 to 6.3% in 2019 and further to 5.4% in 2021. When asked
   about the reasons for replacing foreign employees with local employees,
   30% of responding firms named COVID-19 visa restrictions and 26% the
   visa process in general. However, also about 60% of responding firms
   named the wage level, about 37% better business contacts and 35% (high)
   qualifications of local employees (German Chamber, 2021).^6

   Given the difficulties that companies currently encounter in attracting
   and retaining foreign employees, the decline in the number of foreign
   employees will likely continue. And as the reasons for these
   difficulties are not limited to pandemic-related restrictions, the
   decline is likely to continue even after a (future) lifting of these
   restrictions. According to the European and American companies
   surveyed, those reasons include the unwillingness of qualified
   candidates to relocate to China, high expectations of salary or high
   costs of living and payroll costs, a lack of affordable, quality
   education for children, poor air quality, internet/media restrictions,
   and importantly in the case of American companies also bilateral
   tensions and geopolitical concerns (European Chamber, 2021a; AmCham
   China, 2022).

   Despite COVID-19-related travel restrictions and increasing
   difficulties in retaining and recruiting foreign professionals to
   support their business operations in China, Western companies surveyed
   generally continue to view China as a key market and an attractive
   investment location for the near future. In autumn 2021, almost half of
   British companies surveyed and a large majority of US and German
   companies planned to increase their investment in China over the next
   year or two (British Chamber, 2021; AmCham China, 2022; German Chamber,
   2022).^7 Rather than reducing their China engagement, many companies
   have apparently responded to the challenges by further increasing their
   localisation efforts. For some time now, the majority of European
   companies operating in China have been producing in China primarily for
   the Chinese market and have increasingly been relocating their
   procurement (supply chains) and in some cases also their R&D for the
   Chinese market to China (European Chamber, 2021b). In recent years,
   many companies have further intensified their localisation efforts to
   cope with economic and technological decoupling tendencies spurred by
   political tensions between China and mainly the US but also Europe
   (European Chamber, 2021b; German Chamber, 2022). COVID-19-related
   travel restrictions appear to have reinforced this localisation trend
   by (further) increasing local sourcing and local R&D activities, and
   transferring technical and operational know-how and decision-making
   power to the Chinese subsidiaries (German Chamber, 2022b).

   Overall, the survey results suggest that the replacement of foreign by
   local employees is in part a natural, efficiency-enhancing process, in
   which Western firms take advantage of the growing reservoir of highly
   qualified Chinese workers with well-established local connections to
   reduce (labour) costs and leverage the specific knowledge and
   connections of local workers. The results also suggest, however, that
   many companies are being forced to accelerate this process – beyond
   what they consider optimal – due to significant difficulties in
   attracting and retaining foreign employees. In this case, the (forced)
   replacement of foreign experts by local talent may lead to substantial
   efficiency losses, e.g. in terms of international coordination and
   knowledge transfer within the multinational company. Although the
   number of foreign employees in Western companies in China is generally
   relatively small, they usually hold critical positions that require
   special skills, and they are of great importance in terms of corporate
   culture and the diversity of views in decision-making processes
   (European Chamber, 2021a).

Implications for the Chinese economy

   China’s long-term development goal as emphasised in the 14th Five-Year
   Plan for 2021-2025 is to promote high-quality development that should
   be innovation-driven and predominantly fuelled by the Chinese domestic
   market. Two cornerstones of this new development strategy thus are:
   first, promoting China’s self-reliance and self-improvement in science
   and technology, and second, strengthening China’s domestic economy and
   promoting self-contained domestic supply chains (Bickenbach and Liu,
   2021).

   The observed increase of local sourcing and local R&D activities of
   Western companies over the past years and the amplification of these
   localisation trends by the COVID-19-related travel restrictions may, at
   least on the surface, be in line with the goals emphasised in the
   Five-Year Plan. Other consequences, however, run rather counter to the
   stated goals of the Chinese leadership. The loss of foreign experts and
   China’s reduced attractiveness to foreign talent as well as a decrease
   in knowledge exchange with headquarters abroad that was observed by
   many Western companies (e.g. German Chamber, 2022) are expected to have
   a negative impact on China’s innovation capacity and development. This
   will be felt not only by foreign companies operating in China but also
   by domestic Chinese companies and the Chinese economy as a whole,
   including through reduced knowledge spillovers and learning effects.

   In several key areas, Chinese companies are currently still far from
   the technological leadership that the Chinese government seeks. The
   desired greater self-reliance in science and technology therefore does
   not mean that China does not want (or need) to continue to benefit from
   foreign knowledge. In addition to an increased promotion of its own
   research and innovation, China will continue to seek knowledge and
   technology transfers from abroad. According to the Five-Year Plan,
   China plans to increase its efforts to attract technology-leading
   foreign companies and their research activities, as well as foreign
   scientific and technological talent. In addition, Chinese direct
   investment abroad and targeted acquisitions of leading foreign
   companies in knowledge- and technology-intensive industries are also
   likely to continue to be pursued (Xia and Liu, 2021).

   Similarly, China’s aim of strengthening the domestic market and
   promoting self-contained domestic supply chains should not be
   interpreted as a general retreat from promoting foreign trade and
   investment. The Chinese government also aims to further strengthen
   China’s position as a leading trading power and to foster its
   development towards a manufacturing superpower. For many specific
   technologically and qualitatively demanding (intermediate) products,
   companies in China are currently still dependent on imports and
   suppliers from outside China. China will therefore further need foreign
   trade and investments and the transfer of foreign knowledge to achieve
   its goals.

   Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic and governments’ policies to contain
   the disease have led to a sharp decline in international trade and
   foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first half of 2020. Due, in
   particular, to a relatively successful containment of COVID-19
   infections in China, the Chinese economy recovered earlier than many
   other economies. China thereby contributed substantially to the
   recovery of global trade and foreign investment flows, which surpassed
   their pre-pandemic levels already in 2021 (UNCTAD, 2022a, 2022b). Now,
   there is a serious risk, however, that the further development of the
   Chinese economy and particularly its foreign trade and investments will
   be impeded by China’s continuing travel restrictions and recurring
   lockdowns, and in a more long-term perspective by a continuing decline
   in the number of foreigners in China.

   While the negative short-term economic effects of the strict travel
   restrictions and lockdowns are already apparent (NBSC, 2022), it is
   still too early to empirically assess the longer-term economic impact
   of fewer foreigners living in China. The general literature on the
   relation between immigration and trade, investment and innovation
   clearly suggests, however, that the reduced number of foreigners in
   China is likely to have a negative impact on China’s foreign trade and
   investment as well as on its innovation and growth.

   A large number of empirical studies have clearly confirmed that
   international migration and the presence of foreigners increase
   international trade and FDI (Hatzigeorgiou and Lodefalk, 2021).^8
   Immigrants boost demand for products or services from their home
   country, which is satisfied by increased imports or by companies from
   the migrants’ home country that invest and produce these products in
   the migrants’ host country. In addition, and more importantly in
   general, migrants can facilitate and promote international trade and
   investment by reducing information and transaction costs. They can
   provide information about products, preferences, business practices,
   etc. in foreign markets, improve communication between host and home
   countries, or reduce the costs and uncertainties of negotiating and
   enforcing contracts between trade or investment partners in the two
   countries (Hatzigeorgiou and Lodefalk, 2021; Cuadros et al., 2019).
   Overall, the relevant empirical literature confirms significant
   positive effects of immigration on both bilateral trade (imports as
   well as exports) and bilateral FDI (inward as well as outward FDI)
   between migrants’ host and home countries (Hatzigeorgiou and Lodefalk,
   2021). As for the relevance of personal characteristics of migrants, it
   seems that it is mainly migrants’ occupations rather than their
   education levels that determine their effect on trade and FDI. In
   particular, migrants in occupations that are more closely related to
   business decisions, such as managers and, to a lesser extent,
   professionals seem to have a positive impact on trade (Martin-Montaner
   et al., 2014) and FDI (Cuadros et al., 2019).

   International migration is generally also advantageous for fostering
   innovation in the host countries (Breschi et al., 2016; Venturini et
   al., 2018). High-skilled immigrants bring with them skills and
   knowledge that are generally in high demand in the host countries and
   provide complementary inputs that are crucial for knowledge creation
   and innovation (Stephan and Levin, 2001). Their different cultural
   backgrounds increase local cultural diversity which fosters creativity
   and has a positive impact on patenting and innovation and
   entrepreneurship, especially in knowledge- or technology-intensive
   sectors (e.g. Rodríguez-Pose and Hardy, 2015; Niebuhr, 2010). The
   generally more risk-loving attitude of migrants (Huber and Nowotny,
   2020) is an additional feature favouring the uptake of innovation and
   entrepreneurial activities. The presence of foreign managers and
   experts in the local subsidiaries of foreign multinationals facilitates
   an international knowledge transfer within the multinationals and
   increasing productivity in the subsidiaries (Golob Šušteršič and Zajc
   Kejžar, 2019), which may then spill over to local firms particularly
   with increasing localisation of R&D activities of the multinationals.^9

   In light of these general findings, fewer foreigners living in China
   may mean that China misses opportunities to further intensify its
   international engagement via trade and investments, to speed up
   innovation and to achieve its ambitious growth and development goals.

Conclusions

   In several Chinese provinces, including some of its most international
   ones like Beijing and Shanghai, the number of immigrants has declined
   in 2020 compared to 2010. Over the more than two years of
   pandemic-related travel restrictions, the number of foreigners crossing
   China’s border has decreased dramatically and the number of foreigners
   permanently living in China has further declined. Given the
   continuation of strict COVID-19 restrictions, China’s selective and
   still quite restrictive migration policy, and the increasing resentment
   among the public toward foreigners, the number of foreigners living in
   China may well decline even further in the future.

   The travel restrictions and declining foreign workforce have posed huge
   challenges for both Western multinationals operating in China and the
   Chinese economy as a whole. Many multinationals appear to have
   responded to these challenges by further increasing their localisation
   efforts, partially rather out of necessity and at the expense of firm
   performance. For China as a whole, the declining number of foreign
   experts means that the country may miss opportunities for beneficial
   foreign trade and investments as well as technology transfer and
   innovation, leading to losses in growth and development potential.

   The effects of China’s declining foreign workforce and foreign
   population more generally are not confined to the Chinese economy
   exclusively, however. They are expected to spill over to the world
   economy, above all, via its negative impact on international trade and
   investment. Europe, with its many companies operating in China and
   intensive trade and investment relations, is likely to be affected
   particularly strongly. The “people-to-people decoupling” spurred by
   travel restrictions and the declining number of foreigners in China
   more generally could become another amplifier of the more general
   economic and technological decoupling tendencies between China and the
   West. And it will further reduce mutual understanding between China and
   the West not only in business but also in politics and society at
   large.

     * 3 In Yunnan, the large majority of foreigners are migrant workers
       from neighbouring countries Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos, who have
       been attracted by large disparities in labour markets between
       Yunnan and these neighbouring countries. In addition, there has
       been a booming cross-border marriage market, attracting many
       migrant women to Yunnan. Percentage of immigrants in Yunnan as a
       share of all immigrants in China has increased from less than 5% in
       2010 to about 27% in 2020.
     * 4 The estimation assumes that the number of residents from Hong
       Kong, Macao and Taiwan in Yunnan has grown at the same rate as for
       China as a whole (37.2%).
     * 5 In Beijing and Shanghai, the shares of foreigners were about
       84.8% and 68.8%, respectively, of the total number of immigrants in
       2010 (NBSC, 2012).
     * 6 About one quarter of respondents named the Individual Income Tax
       (IIT) reform, which was planned to take effect on 1 January 2022,
       but was postponed by two years in December 2021. The reform
       stipulated the elimination of tax exemptions for certain benefits
       for foreigners (e.g. for housing expenses, children’s education
       expenses, language training expenses and home leave expenses),
       which would have resulted in larger tax liabilities for many
       foreign employees.
     * 7 The Omicron outbreaks and subsequent strict lockdowns in Shanghai
       and several other Chinese provinces in spring 2022 seem to have
       soured the investment plans of US companies in China, however. By
       end of March 2022, 17% (29%) of the respondents to a small-scale
       survey of American companies in China stated that the recent
       Omicron outbreak led to a decrease (delay) of planned investments.
       About 50% of companies said they would reduce investments if the
       current COVID-19 restrictions remain in place for the next year
       (AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai, 2022).
     * 8 Most of the studies on the relation between immigration and trade
       and immigration and FDI relate to the effects of immigration to
       North American or European countries. The validity of the results
       for immigration to China is therefore empirically still an open
       question. From a theoretical perspective, however, the trade and
       investment promoting effects of migrants are expected to be larger
       for countries that are less similar culturally and for less
       developed countries, where institutions are weaker and doing
       business with foreigners entails a higher degree of insecurity.
       Migrants may therefore be expected to have a particularly large
       impact on Western companies’ trade and investment relations with
       China.
     * 9 Most of the studies on the migration-innovation nexus focus on
       the US and Europe as host countries. Findings from Bahar et al.
       (2022) suggest, however, that the positive innovation impact of
       international migration is not limited to the developed countries,
       but have also helped to increase innovation in emerging economies.
