The Stranger, The Outsider and The Foreigner

   title of Camus’ most famous book- L’Étranger. In French, this word
   carries three associated but nevertheless distinct meanings: the
   stranger, the foreigner and the outsider. All of these words have some
   degree of claim to representing the French title, and conveying Camus’
   intentions, but none of them can truly represent the meaning of the
   original word. As it is, the title is usually translated as either The
   Outsider or The Stranger, although The Outsider proves the less popular
   choice; probably due to the phonic similarity between ‘stranger’ and
   the original title.

   French literature – ‘Aujourd’hui, maman est mort’- and the debate
   continues. How do we translate ‘maman’? Mersault, the main character,
   is a cold, unfeeling outsider (or stranger); the choice of how he
   reacts to his mother’s death will set the tone for the novel as a
   whole. Mother is too cold and formal, mum is too monosyllabic and
   informal. ‘Maman’ sits between the two and is the reason that Matthew
   Ward left it untranslated in his edition (he also plumped for The
   Stranger).  Recently, a new edition of L’Étranger was published that
   translated the line as ‘My mother died today’, introducing a new warmth
   and sentimental attachment.
