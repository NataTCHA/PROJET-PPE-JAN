Abstract

   The perpetual foreigner stereotype posits that members of ethnic
   minorities will always be seen as the "other" in the White Anglo-Saxon
   dominant society of the United States (Devos & Banaji, 2005), which may
   have negative implications for them. The goal of the present research
   was to determine whether awareness of this perpetual foreigner
   stereotype predicts identity and psychological adjustment. We conducted
   a series of studies with 231 Asian Americans and 211 Latino/as (Study
   1), 89 African Americans (Study 2), and 56 Asian Americans and 165
   Latino/as (Study 3). All participants completed measures of perceived
   discrimination, awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype,
   conflict between ethnic and national identities, sense of belonging to
   American culture, and demographics. In Study 3, participants also
   completed measures of psychological adjustment: depression, hope, and
   life satisfaction. All participants were students at a large, public
   university on the West Coast of the United States. Across studies, we
   found that even after controlling for perceived discrimination,
   awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype was a significant
   predictor of identity conflict and lower sense of belonging to American
   culture. From Study 3, we also found that, above and beyond perceived
   discrimination, awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype
   significantly predicted lower hope and life satisfaction for Asian
   Americans, and that it was a marginal predictor of greater depression
   for Latino/as. These results suggest that the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype may play a role in ethnic minority identity and adjustment.

   "Where are you from?" This benign question is commonly asked during
   social interactions, and the answer often leads to interesting
   conversations with strangers or acquaintances. But what if an answer
   like "Lincoln, Nebraska," "Baltimore, Maryland," or "Modesto,
   California" does not suffice for the questioner? Indeed, ethnic
   minorities, especially Asian Americans and Latino/as, are often asked
   follow-up questions like, "No, where are you really from?" or "I meant,
   where are you originally from?" (Liang, Li, & Kim, 2004; Sue,
   Capodilupo et al., 2007). At least under some circumstances,
   experiences such as these may be perceived by some ethnic minorities as
   a message that they do not share the American identity or have in-group
   status; therefore, these experiences may have negative implications for
   their identity and adjustment. Thus, in a series of three studies
   involving three major American ethnic minority groups, we sought to
   demonstrate that members of ethnic minorities are aware of this
   perpetual foreigner stereotype (Cheryan & Monin, 2005; Devos & Banaji,
   2005), and this awareness is linked to their sense of belonging to
   American society, sense of conflict between ethnic and national
   identities, and psychological adjustment.

THE PERPETUAL FOREIGNER STEREOTYPE

   Although the United States is historically an immigrant nation with an
   ethnically and culturally diverse population, members of ethnic
   minority groups are often innocuously denied the American identity and
   treated as if they were perpetual foreigners." This especially is
   evident in recent research that shows an overwhelming propensity to
   more readily ascribe the American identity to European Americans rather
   than to ethnic minorities (Devos & Banaji, 2005; Devos, Gavin, &
   Quintana, 2010; Devos & Heng, 2009; Devos & Ma, 2008; Rydell, Hamilton,
   & Devos, 2010). Even when ethnic minorities are explicitly judged to be
   American, implicitly, in the minds of both European Americans and some
   ethnic minorities (Asian Americans and Latino/as), being "American" is
   equated with being White.

   The assumption that ethnic minorities do not fit the definition of what
   it means to be American may manifest itself in subtle, covert
   marginalizing incidents, such as questioning an individual's home-town,
   complimenting his/her command of the English language, or mistaking
   him/her as a foreigner (Liang et al., 2004). These behaviors comprise a
   contemporary form of racism called racial microaggression, whereby
   racism is disguised in supposedly benign behaviors and comments (e.g.,
   Where are you from?) that convey strong messages of exclusion and
   inferiority (Sue, Capodilupo, et al., 2007). Even when the intent of
   perpetrators, who can be of any ethnic or racial group, is not
   malicious or racially motivated, it is in these seemingly harmless
   occurrences that ethnic minorities are told that they are somehow less
   American than European Americans.

   Research on the extent to which ethnic minorities are aware of being
   stereotyped as foreigners is limited. In a study on identity denial, or
   the acceptance threat that results when an individual who does not
   match the prototype of an in-group sees his/her identity called into
   question or unrecognized by fellow group members, Asian Americans were
   indeed aware of being denied the American identity by others despite
   the fact that they feel just as American as European Americans (Cheryan
   & Monin, 2005). The study also identified situations of identity denial
   in everyday interactions for Asian Americans and Latino/as, who
   reported being misperceived as being from another country or a
   nonnative English speaker significantly more often than European
   Americans. Similarly, African American and Cuban American women
   reported feeling excluded from the national category by European
   Americans (Barlow, Taylor, & Lambert, 2000). Although these experiences
   may be qualitatively different for Asian Americans and Latino/as (who
   are likely to be mistaken as immigrants when they are native-born) than
   for African Americans (who are likely to experience other forms
   exclusion from the American identity as a result of the "exclusionary
   patriotism" discussed below; Sidanius & Petrocik, 2001), these findings
   suggest that overall, ethnic minorities are aware that they are
   perceived as less American and, in some cases, more foreign than
   European Americans.

PERPETUAL FOREIGNER STEREOTYPE AND IDENTITY

   Although the denial of ethnic minorities' American identity is a
   phenomenon that has been identified in the literature (e.g., Cheryan &
   Monin, 2005; Devos & Banaji, 2005; Sue, Capodilupo, et al., 2007), the
   link, if any, between awareness of this perpetual foreigner stereotype,
   identity, and psychological adjustment has not been directly examined.
   In terms of identity, Cheryan and Monin (2005) found that identity
   denial impacted Asian Americans' everyday behavior, especially when
   they felt that their American identity was in question. In response to
   identity threat, they used identity assertion techniques, such as
   demonstrating awareness of popular American culture and engaging more
   in American practices to assert their American identity. In Barlow et
   al.'s (2000) study with African American women, feelings of exclusion
   from the national identity by European Americans were related to how
   African American women perceive their own group, such that those who
   felt more excluded held more pessimistic views of the economic and
   social position of African Americans, regardless of their actual
   socioeconomic status. Researchers have also identified a significant
   and negative correlation between perceived prejudice and negative
   self-concept among Japanese Americans, suggesting that the more this
   minority group was aware of negative prejudice against them, the more
   negatively they viewed themselves (Asamen & Berry, 1987). These
   findings all indicate a potential link between how an individual
   believes he/she is perceived by others and his/her own perception of
   the self. In the present research, we were particularly interested in
   the association between awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype
   and subjective reports of conflict between one's ethnic and national
   identities, as well as feelings of belonging to mainstream American
   culture.

Conflict Between Ethnic and National Identities

   If minority groups are, to some extent, cognizant that they are
   psychologically denied the American identity, we expect that the
   awareness of being perceived as a foreigner may account for subjective
   reports of internal conflict between their ethnic and national
   identities. Benet-Martinez and Haritatos's (2005) work on bicultural
   identity integration indicated that some bicultural individuals have
   difficulty incorporating their national and ethnic cultures into a
   cohesive sense of self. These bicultural individuals were also
   particularly sensitive to specific tensions between their national and
   ethnic cultural orientations and saw this incompatibility as a source
   of internal conflict. If ethnic minorities are continually excluded
   from the national identity and reminded that they do not typify what it
   means to be American, it would be expected that they experience some
   degree of internal conflict.

   Research on the perceived interrelations between multiple social
   identities and social identity complexity theory suggests that the less
   a person perceives the different groups to which he/she belongs as
   being similar to each other, the more complex his or her social
   identity will be (Roccas & Brewer, 2002). When multiple group
   identities are not convergent, they may become conflicting or even
   competing, such that the individual feels he/she must choose between
   one identity or another. In the case of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype, individuals whose American identity is often called into
   question may conclude that they are not perceived as being as American
   as European Americans. Thus, we hypothesized that one's awareness of
   being perceived by others as a foreigner would predict one's sense of
   conflict between ethnic and national identities.

Sense of Belonging in America

   Additionally, we investigated whether awareness of the perpetual
   foreigner stereotype is associated with feelings of belonging in
   America. A study of ethnic and American identity among ethnic minority
   adolescents suggested that many feel as if American or mainstream
   culture generally means White and thus does not include them (Phinney,
   Cantu, & Kurtz, 1997). According to this research, American identity is
   likely to be associated with a heightened sense of belonging to the
   White majority for European Americans. Conversely, it can be expected
   that membership in an ethnic minority group is associated with a
   relatively lowered sense of belonging to the mainstream culture. Such
   seems to be the case in research based on social dominance theory
   (Sidanius, Feshbach, Levin, & Pratto, 1997), which suggests that
   belongingness to the nation as a whole is more strongly and positively
   associated with membership in the dominant ethnic group and less
   strongly associated with membership in subordinate ethnic groups.
   Simply being a member of an ethnic minority seems to entail a certain
   degree of exclusion from the national identity, potentially
   contributing to feelings of marginalization and a decreased sense of
   belonging to mainstream America.

   Further evidence for ethnic minorities' relative lack of sense of
   belonging in America may be seen in research on national attachment, in
   which European Americans reported the greatest amount of patriotism and
   nationalism compared to Asian Americans, Latino/as, and African
   Americans (Sidanius et al., 1997). Minorities' relative lack of
   patriotism (defined as a love for one's country and its major symbols)
   and nationalism (the desire for the dominance of one's own nation over
   others) may be attributable to the "exclusionary patriotism" that
   emerges in a multiethnic society (Sidanius & Petrocik, 2001). According
   to this perspective, the socially dominant group is more identified
   with the nation's symbols and public institutions, which may lead to
   questions like "Where are you really from?" directed at visible
   minorities in various countries around the world where there is an
   immigrant or ethnic minority population. In the United States, this
   unequal association between that which is American and different ethnic
   groups may contribute to and perpetuate the exclusion of ethnic
   minorities from the national identity. If one group enjoys a greater
   sense of identification with the mainstream culture, then other groups
   who do not fit the majority picture can be expected to feel excluded or
   marginalized from this identity. Thus, based on the above concurrent
   findings on sense of belonging and national attachment, we expected
   individuals who feel frequently reminded of their perpetual foreigner
   status and consequently psychologically denied the American identity to
   feel marginalized from mainstream American society and to experience a
   lessened sense of belonging to the national identity. In other words,
   we hypothesized that an individual's sense of belonging to mainstream
   American culture would be predicted by his/her awareness of being
   perceived as a foreigner.

PERPETUAL FOREIGNER STEREOTYPE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT

   In addition to the relations with identity, we were also interested in
   the association between awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype
   and psychological adjustment, including mental health (depression) and
   well-being (hope and life satisfaction). Previous research suggests
   that subtle forms of racism, such as racial micro-aggressions and the
   perpetual foreigner stereotype, may be detrimental to victims'
   psychological health, like old-fashioned, overt racism (Sue,
   Capodilupo, et al., 2007). For example, targets of racial
   microaggressions report experiencing anxiety, stress, helplessness,
   academic disengagement, anger, and frustration (Smith, Allen, & Danley,
   2007; Solorzano, Ceja, & Yosso, 2000). The perpetual foreigner
   stereotype is particularly salient for Asian Americans, for whom being
   treated as an alien in one's own land is associated with feelings of
   inferiority, discomfort, and isolation (Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, &
   Torino, 2007). Although the above studies provide a rich and detailed
   understanding of racial microaggressions, including the perpetual
   foreigner stereotype, they are all purely qualitative in nature and
   restricted to one ethnic group. In the current set of quantitative
   studies, we hypothesized that awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype will predict higher levels of depression and lower levels of
   hope and life satisfaction for both Latino/as and Asian Americans
   (Study 3, which does not include African American participants). These
   adjustment variables, which include psychological symptoms and positive
   functioning, have been the focus of much research on perceived
   discrimination (e.g., Klonoff & Landrine, 1999; Neto, 2001; discussed
   below), so they were chosen to provide evidence of incremental validity
   for the perpetual foreigner stereotype construct.

THE ROLE OF PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION

   When studying identity and psychological adjustment among ethnic
   minorities, it is important also to consider the role played by
   perceived discrimination. It could be said that perceived
   discrimination, as it is typically measured, refers to a more blatant
   form of discrimination than the perpetual foreigner stereotype, which
   constitutes a more subtle form of discrimination (Devos & Banaji, 2005;
   Sue, Capodilupo, et al., 2007). Experiences with both forms of
   discrimination may have negative implications for ethnic minorities,
   and they may independently account for the identity and psychological
   outcomes of interest. For example, with regard to identity, a study on
   Chinese Americans found that perceived discrimination predicts a
   greater sense of conflict between one's ethnic and national identities
   (Benet-Martinez & Haritatos, 2005). Furthermore, perceived
   discrimination is related to a lower sense of belonging among Latino/a
   college students (Levin, Van Laar, & Foote, 2006). Previous research
   has also found consistent and moderate associations between perceived
   discrimination and psychological maladjustment. For example, perceived
   discrimination predicts distress symptoms, such as depression and
   anxiety, for African American adults (Klonoff & Landrine, 1999;
   Klonoff, Landrine, & Ullman, 1999; Pieterse & Carter, 2007). Perceived
   discrimination is also related to higher depression, anxiety, and
   psychosomatic symptoms for Vietnamese adolescents in Finland (Liebkind,
   Jasinskaja-Lahti, & Solheim, 2004) and Latino/a adolescents in the
   United States (Smokowski & Bacallao, 2007). In addition, perceived
   discrimination has been theorized to be related to lowered hope (Adams
   et al., 2003), and it has been found to be related to lowered life
   satisfaction for immigrants in several different settlement countries
   (e.g., Neto, 2001; Sam, 2001; Vohra & Adair, 2000). Based on these
   findings, we expected that perceived discrimination would be related to
   identity and psychological adjustment, but we hypothesized that the
   perpetual foreigner stereotype would predict identity and psychological
   adjustment above and beyond perceived discrimination.

THE CURRENT STUDIES

   The goals of the current studies were two-fold: (1) to examine the
   perpetual foreigner stereotype and perceived discrimination in
   different ethnic minority groups, and (2) to determine the potential
   implications of the perpetual foreigner stereotype for individuals'
   identity and psychological adjustment. Specifically, we hypothesized
   that exposure to the perpetual foreigner stereotype and discrimination
   would be a more common experience for ethnic minorities than for
   European Americans, such that Asian Americans, Latino/as, and African
   Americans would report both higher awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype and higher perceived discrimination as compared to European
   Americans. Moreover, after controlling for the effects of perceived
   discrimination, the perpetual foreigner stereotype should predict (a) a
   greater sense of conflict between one's ethnic and national identities,
   (b) a lower sense of belonging to mainstream American society, (c)
   higher levels of depression symptoms, (d) lower levels of hope, and (e)
   lower levels of life satisfaction among ethnic minorities. We tested
   the first hypothesis about awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype using data from Asian Americans (Studies 1 and 3), Latino/as
   (Studies 1 and 3), and African Americans (Study 2); hypotheses about
   the potential implications of the stereotype on identity using data
   from all three ethnic minority groups (Studies 1 and 2); and hypotheses
   about the potential implications of the stereotype on psychological
   adjustment using data from Asian Americans and Latino/as (Study 3).

STUDY 1

   To examine awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype and
   perceived experiences of discrimination among different ethnic groups,
   we collected data from Asian Americans, Latino/as, and European
   Americans in Study 1. We also examined the link between the awareness
   of being viewed as a perpetual foreigner and important facets of
   identity.

METHOD

Participants

   Participants were 836 undergraduate students from a large, public
   university on the West Coast of the United States. There were 231 Asian
   Americans, 211 Latino/as, and 394 European Americans. The sample ranged
   in age from 17 to 42 years (M = 19.15, SD = 2.01), most of whom were
   college freshmen, and there were 568 (68.0%) women. All participants
   were American citizens, and most European Americans were third+
   generation Americans, whereas most Asian Americans and Latino/as were
   second+ generation Americans. See Table 1 for complete participant
   demographics.

Measures

   Participants completed a series of measures assessing perceived
   discrimination, awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype,
   perception of conflict between ethnic and national identities, sense of
   belonging to American culture, and basic demographics. All items were
   rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 =
   strongly agree). Table 2 shows arithmetic means, standard deviations,
   and Cronbach's alphas for all scales, and Table 3 shows correlations
   among measured variables.

   correlations significant at the p < 0.01 level (two-tailed).

Perceived Discrimination

   To measure perceived discrimination, we used the Perceived
   Discrimination subscale (9 items) from the Scale of Ethnic Experience
   (Malcarne, Chavira, Fernandez, & Liu, 2006). Sample items include: "In
   my life, I have experienced prejudice because of my ethnicity" and
   "Discrimination against my ethnic group is not a problem in America"
   (reverse scored).

Awareness of the Perpetual Foreigner Stereotype

   Thirteen items measured the extent to which participants believed they
   were perceived as a foreigner (as opposed to an American citizen) by
   others, without reference to the race or ethnicity of the perpetrator.
   Sample items include: "Sometimes people think I am a foreigner" and
   "Most people have difficulty viewing me as an American." These items
   were developed specifically for the present research and were generated
   using input from an ethnically diverse group of college students (see
   Appendix).

Perception of Identity Conflict

   Six items measured the extent to which participants experienced a
   conflict between their ethnic and national identities. Some of these
   items were modified from the conflict subscale of the Bicultural
   Identity Integration Scale-Version 1 (Benet-Martinez & Haritatos, 2005)
   to focus on national and ethnic identities (rather than on cultural
   identities) for this study. Sample items include: "I am conflicted
   between my ethnic and American identities" and "In some situations, I
   feel pressured to choose between my American and ethnic identities."

Sense of Belonging

   To measure participants' feelings of belonging to mainstream American
   society, we used the Mainstream Comfort subscale (6 items) from the
   Scale of Ethnic Experience (Malcarne et al., 2006). Sample items
   include: "I feel like I belong to mainstream American culture" and "I
   think of myself as a typical American."

PROCEDURE

   Participants were recruited through advertisements in the daily campus
   newspaper (paid) and the psychology department subject pool (unpaid).
   Paid respondents were given $15, and subject pool respondents received
   partial credit for an introductory psychology course for their
   participation in the study. All participants completed all
   questionnaires on a computer in small groups of up to 4. Computers were
   located in cubicles in a small lab setting, and there were screens
   between each computer desk for privacy. Measures were completed in the
   following order: awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype,
   perception of conflict between ethnic and national identities, Scale of
   Ethnic Experience (including the perceived discrimination and sense of
   belonging subscales), and demographics.

RESULTS

   As expected, contrast analyses showed that European Americans (M =
   1.96, SD = 0.59) reported significantly lower perceived discrimination
   than Asian Americans (M = 3.00, SD = 0.65) and Latino/as (M = 3.51, SD
   = 0.64) in our sample; [lambda] = +/-2, 1, 1; t(833) = 30.19, p = 7.23
   x 10^+/-136, r[contrast] = .72, 95% CI: .70 to .76. Contrast analyses
   also showed that European Americans (M = 1.57, SD = 0.49) reported
   significantly lower awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype
   toward the self than Asian Americans (M = 2.71, SD = 0.67) and
   Latino/as (M = 2.65, SD = 0.75); [lambda] = +/-2, 1, 1; t(760.53) =
   26.42, p = 1.13 x 10^+/-109, r[contrast] = .68, 95% CI: .64 to .72. In
   sum, as compared to European Americans, ethnic minorities perceived
   more discrimination toward them and their ethnic group, and they were
   more aware that others perceive them as less American and more foreign.
   These findings are in line with previous research suggesting that
   ethnic minorities are indeed more aware that they are stereotyped as
   foreigners (Barlow et al., 2000; Cheryan & Monin, 2005; Liang et al.,
   2004).

   Not only did European Americans report significantly lower perceived
   discrimination and awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype than
   Asian Americans and Latino/as in our sample (see Table 2), their
   arithmetic means were well below the midpoint of the scales. This
   suggests that perceived discrimination and the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype are not routinely experienced by members of this ethnic
   group. Because the goal of our study was to examine the relation
   between these two forms of ethnic discrimination and identity, we did
   not include European American participants in the following regression
   analyses.

   To test our hypothesis that awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype predicts the outcomes of interest above and beyond perceived
   discrimination, we conducted hierarchical regression analyses
   separately for Asian Americans and Latino/as (see Table 4 for
   regression results). Using data from Asian Americans only, we found
   that even after controlling for perceived discrimination, awareness of
   the perpetual foreigner stereotype was a significant predictor of both
   perception of identity conflict, [Delta]R^2 = .14, F(1, 228) = 44.12, p
   = 2.24 x 10^+/-10, and lower sense of belonging to American culture,
   [Delta]R^2 = .14, F(1, 228) = 44.38, p = 2.00 x 10^+/-10. Likewise,
   using data from Latino/as only, we found that awareness of the
   perpetual foreigner stereotype significantly predicted perception of
   identity conflict, [Delta]R^2 = .18, F(1, 208) = 55.58, p = 2.38 x
   10^+/-12, and lower sense of belonging to American culture, [Delta]R^2
   = .24, F(1, 208) = 78.50, p = 3.60 x 10^+/-16, over and above perceived
   discrimination.

STUDY 2

   Based on research on "exclusionary patriotism" (Sidanius & Petrocik,
   2001), we would expect African Americans also to feel excluded from the
   national identity and marginalized from mainstream American society,
   relative to their European American counterparts. This sense of
   exclusion and marginalization may come in subtle forms, such as
   implying that African Americans are not typical Americans (even if most
   of them are not seen as foreigners in the common meaning of the term).
   Thus, to determine whether findings on Asian Americans and Latino/as in
   Study 1 extend to African Americans, we conducted Study 2.

METHOD

Participants

   Participants were 151 undergraduate students from the same large,
   public university on the West Coast of the United States. There were 89
   African Americans and 62 European Americans. The sample ranged in age
   from 18 to 45 years (M = 19.62, SD = 4.04), most of whom were college
   freshmen, and there were 111 (73.5%) women. All participants were
   American citizens, and most participants were third+ generation
   Americans. See Table 1 for complete participant demographics.

Measures

   Participants in Study 2 were administered the same measures as in Study
   1: perceived discrimination, awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype, perception of conflict between ethnic and national
   identities, sense of belonging to American culture, and basic
   demographics. All items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale,
   ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Table 2 shows
   arithmetic means, standard deviations, and Cronbach's alphas for all
   scales, and Table 5 shows correlations among measured variables.

   Note. N = 89. Correlations significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed) are

   bolded.

Procedure

   Study 2 participants were recruited through the same methods as Study 1
   participants, and they completed the study in the same setting as Study
   1 participants. Measures were completed in the same order as in Study
   1.

RESULTS

   As expected, European Americans (M = 2.11, SD = 0.58) reported
   significantly lower perceived discrimination than African Americans (M
   = 3.92, SD = 0.59) in our sample, t(149) = 18.68, p = 7.25 x 10^+/-41,
   r = .84, 95% CI: .78 to .88 (see Table 2). In addition, European
   Americans (M = 1.54, SD = 0.55) reported significantly lower awareness
   of the perpetual foreigner stereotype toward the self than African
   Americans (M = 2.33, SD = 0.64); t(149) = 7.83, p = 8.33 x 10^+/-13, r
   = .54, 95% CI: .42 to .65. As in Study 1, we conducted hierarchical
   regression analyses to determine whether awareness of the perpetual
   foreigner stereotype among African Americans predicts the outcomes of
   interest above and beyond perceived discrimination (see Table 4 for
   regression results). We found that awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype was a significant predictor of perception of identity
   conflict, [Delta]R^2 = .07, F(1, 86) = 8.12, p = .005, and lower sense
   of belonging to American culture, [Delta]R^2 = .26, F(1, 86) = 32.18, p
   = 1.85 x 10^+/-7, over and above perceived discrimination.

   Thus, results from Studies 1 and 2 suggest that for the three major
   American ethnic minority groups in our samples ---Asian Americans,
   Latino/as, and African Americans ---the perpetual foreigner stereotype
   is an important predictor of identity, such that participants who
   report that they are seen as perpetual foreigners also are more likely
   to perceive conflict between their national and ethnic identities and
   feel less comfortable in mainstream American culture, even when we
   control for perceived discrimination. In addition, although there is a
   reliable small-medium correlation between these two variables
   (awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype and perceived
   discrimination; see Tables 3 and and5)5) in these three samples, they
   each independently account for the identity outcomes of interest.

STUDY 3

   In addition to examining identity, we also wanted to determine whether
   the perpetual foreigner stereotype is an important predictor of
   psychological adjustment; thus, we conducted Study 3. Specifically, we
   were interested in whether awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype predicts mental health (depression) and well-being (hope and
   life satisfaction) above and beyond perceived discrimination among
   Latino/as and Asian Americans.

METHOD

Participants

   Participants were 165 Latino/a and 56 Asian American undergraduate
   students from the same large, public university on the West Coast of
   the United States. Because of the relative difficulty of recruiting
   African American participants on the campus, we did not include this
   ethnic group in Study 3. The Latino/a sample ranged in age from 18 to
   32 years (M = 19.47, SD = 2.16), and the Asian American sample ranged
   in age from 18 to 24 years (M = 19.64, SD = 1.38). Most of both samples
   were college freshmen or sophomores. There were 104 (63.0%) Latinas and
   37 (66.1%) Asian American women. All participants were American
   citizens, and most of them were second+ generation Americans. See Table
   1 for complete participant demographics.

Measures

   In addition to completing the measures from Study 1 (perceived
   discrimination, awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype,
   perception of conflict between ethnic and national identities, sense of
   belonging to American culture, and basic demographics), participants in
   Study 3 completed measures of psychological adjustment: mental health
   (depression) and well-being (hope and life satisfaction). Table 2 shows
   arithmetic means, standard deviations, and Cronbach's alphas for all
   scales, and Table 6 shows correlations among measured variables for
   both samples.

   correlations significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) are bolded.

Depression

   We used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (20
   items; Radloff, 1977) to assess depression symptoms, including
   depressive feelings and behaviors. Respondents were asked to rate their
   level of depressive symptomatology during the previous 7 days,
   including the day of the study, on a 4-point Likert-type scale, 1 =
   rarely or none of the time (< 1 day) to 4 = most or all of the time
   (5-7 days). Sample items include: "I was bothered by things that
   usually don't bother me" and "I felt sad."

Hope

   Six items of the State Hope Scale measured the extent to which
   participants felt hopeful (sense of agency or "belief in one's capacity
   to initiate and sustain actions" and pathways to reach goals or "belief
   in one's capacity to generate routes") about their lives currently
   (Snyder et al., 1996, p. 321). Respondents were asked to rate the items
   on an 8-point Likert-type scale (1 = definitely false to 8 = definitely
   true). Sample items include: "At the present time, I am energetically
   pursuing my goals" (agency) and "There are lots of ways around any
   problem that I am facing now" (pathways).

Life Satisfaction

   Five items from the Satisfaction With Life Scale measured the extent to
   which participants feel satisfied with their lives currently (Diener,
   Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). Respondents were asked to rate the
   items on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 =
   strongly agree). Sample items include: "In most ways my life is close
   to my ideal" and "I am satisfied with my life."

Procedure

   Study 3 participants were recruited through the same methods as Study 1
   participants, and they completed the study in the same setting as Study
   1 participants. The psychological adjustment measures were randomized
   in this study, and they were administered after the discrimination and
   identity measures, before the basic demographics.

RESULTS

   Replicating our Study 1 results with Latino/as and Asian Americans, we
   found that even after controlling for perceived discrimination,
   awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype was a significant
   predictor of perception of identity conflict and lower sense of
   belonging for both groups in Study 3 (see Table 4 for regression
   results).

   Furthermore, we found that for Latino/as, awareness of the perpetual
   foreigner stereotype was a marginal predictor of depression over and
   above perceived discrimination, [Delta]R^2 = .02, F(1, 162) = 3.53, p =
   .06. Contrary to our hypothesis, awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype did not significantly predict hope, [Delta]R^2 = .003, F(1,
   162) = 0.45, p = .50, or life satisfaction, [Delta]R^2 = .008, F(1,
   162) = 1.40, p = .24, above and beyond perceived discrimination for
   Latino/as.

   For Asian Americans, awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype
   was not a significant predictor of depression over and above perceived
   discrimination, [Delta]R^2 = .02, F(1, 53) = 1.09, p = .30. However, it
   significantly predicted hope, [Delta]R^2 = .09, F(1, 53) = 5.31, p =
   .03, and life satisfaction, [Delta]R^2 = .07, F(1, 53) = 5.47, p = .03,
   above and beyond perceived discrimination for Asian Americans.

   In summary, results from Study 3 suggest that for Asian Americans and
   Latino/as, the perpetual foreigner stereotype is a predictor of
   different types of psychological adjustment. In particular,
   participants who report that they are seen as perpetual foreigners
   report more depressive symptoms (for Latino/as), and lower hope and
   lower life satisfaction (for Asian Americans), even when we control for
   perceived discrimination.

DISCUSSION

   The present research sought to systematically document ethnic
   minorities' awareness of being stereotyped as perpetual foreigners and
   examine the links between this awareness, identity, and psychological
   adjustment. Together, our studies demonstrate that to various degrees,
   ethnic minorities but not European Americans perceive that they are the
   targets of the perpetual foreigner stereotype, and that this subtle
   form of exclusion is linked to ethnic minorities' identity and some
   types of psychological adjustment. Specifically, as predicted, Asian
   Americans (Study 1), Latino/as (Study 1), and African Americans (Study
   2) report significantly higher awareness of the perpetual foreigner
   stereotype toward them than do European Americans (Studies 1 and 2).^1
   Also as hypothesized, variations in the awareness of being stereotyped
   as a foreigner is associated with perceptions of conflict between an
   individual's ethnic and national identities, even after controlling for
   perceived discrimination, providing evidence of incremental validity
   for the perpetual foreigner construct (Studies 1-3). Asian Americans,
   Latino/as, and African Americans who perceive that they are not seen as
   Americans by others report experiencing greater tension between their
   ethnic and national identities than those who are less cognizant of
   these perceptions. As was shown in research on bicultural identity
   integration (Benet-Martinez & Haritatos, 2005), it may be more
   difficult for some members of an ethnic minority group to incorporate
   their national and ethnic cultures into a cohesive sense of self. These
   results may have implications for social identity complexity theory
   (Roccas & Brewer, 2002), which suggests that the less a person
   perceives the different groups to which he/she belongs as being similar
   to each other, the more complex his/her social identity will be. The
   current findings suggest that some ethnic minorities' awareness of
   being perceived as foreigners may contribute to the perception that
   their ethnic and national identities are dissimilar and even
   incompatible, thereby forcing them to maintain a more complex social
   identity. This could be a source of conflict for these individuals, who
   may have to choose between their ethnic and national identities
   (Benet-Martinez & Haritatos, 2005). Compared with European Americans,
   whose American identity is readily recognized, members of ethnic
   minority groups, who are cognizant that their American identity is
   viewed skeptically by others, experience significantly more tensions in
   their efforts to form a unified and integrated identity.

   The awareness of being perceived as a foreigner also is associated with
   weakened sense of belonging in America (Studies 1-3). As hypothesized,
   the extent to which an individual is aware of being viewed as a
   foreigner is highly correlated with his/her inability to feel part of
   the national identity, even after controlling for perceived
   discrimination. Some ethnic minorities, aware of the stereotypes
   against them, may be led to question whether or not they truly belong
   in the United States. If fellow Americans treat them as outsiders or as
   if they do not represent that which is American, how can minority group
   members be expected to see themselves as American? These findings
   support the idea that many ethnic minorities see mainstream American
   culture as generally meaning White and thus feel excluded from the
   national identity (see also Phinney et al., 1997). Consequently, Asian
   Americans', Latino/as', and African Americans' awareness of being
   perceived as not American may ultimately inhibit their ability to feel
   like they belong in America or lead to a relative dis-identification
   with mainstream American culture. These findings may have implications
   for ethnic minority group participation in civic life, including
   voting, volunteerism, military service, and other aspects of citizen
   involvement, all of which are bolstered by a sense of identification
   with the group (in this case, the American identity). Perceiving
   exclusion in the form of the perpetual foreigner stereotype may
   discourage some ethnic minorities from actively participating in
   American society.

   In addition to the strong correlations between ethnic minorities'
   awareness of being stereotyped and their identity, their subjective
   experiences with the perpetual foreigner stereotype are moderately
   linked to adjustment. As expected, ethnic minorities who are more aware
   of the perpetual foreigner stereotype tend to report greater depression
   (for Latino/as, Study 3) and lower hope or life-satisfaction (for Asian
   Americans, Study 3), even after controlling for perceived
   discrimination, providing further evidence for the incremental validity
   of the perpetual foreigner construct.^2 It should be emphasized that
   the patterns of associations between the perpetual foreigner stereotype
   and adjustment are different for Latino/as and Asian Americans. It is
   possible that the perpetual foreigner stereotype operates differently
   for these two groups. For example, American history ---with wars in
   Japan, Korea, and Viet Nam, and fears of the yellow peril with regard
   to Chinese immigrants ---is rife with conceptions of Asians (and thus
   Asian Americans) as foreign and dangerous enemies (Takaki, 1998).
   Conversely, the messages regarding the foreign-ness of Latino/as are
   mixed. Although some Latino/as are racially White, and some have
   ancestors who lived on this land before the United States was founded,
   the recent immigration debates have focused on Latino/as, often
   labeling them as illegal aliens. It is also possible that adjustment
   and well-being are expressed and reported differently by Latino/as and
   Asian Americans. For example, some Asian Americans may find that it is
   more culturally acceptable to experience depression psychosomatically
   and to report physical problems than it is to report symptoms of
   depression (Chun, Enomoto, & Sue, 1996; U.S. Department of Health and
   Human Services, 2001).

   Overall, our findings are in line with the racial microaggressions
   perspective, which suggests that subtle forms of racism, such as being
   perceived by others as foreigners even when one identifies as American,
   may be detrimental to the victim's psychological adjustment (Sue,
   Capodilupo, et al., 2007). American ethnic minorities who feel that
   they are frequently perceived as foreigners and denied their ingroup
   status may feel conflicted about their national identity and have a
   sense of cultural homelessness, which in turn can lead to poorer
   overall psychological adjustment. That is, these feelings of conflict
   and exclusion may cause ethnic minorities to experience depression
   symptoms, lose hope, and become less satisfied overall with their
   lives. These findings may also be interpreted in the reverse direction:
   individuals who have lower overall well-being (experience more identity
   conflict and lower sense of belonging, more depressive symptoms, feel
   more hopeless about life, and have lower life satisfaction) also
   perceive less acceptance from mainstream American society, or have a
   generally more negative outlook on life. Thus, they also report more
   awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype. More research is
   needed to determine the complex causal pathways among these variables.

   Another way in which exposure to the perpetual foreigner stereotype may
   negatively impact ethnic minorities' psychological adjustment can be
   viewed in light of research on stigma consciousness (Pinel, 1999).
   According to this theoretical framework, individuals or groups that
   regularly contend with stereotypical or prejudicial reactions have
   higher expectations of being the target of these types of responses
   than groups that do not. Similarly, ethnic minorities who are
   frequently reminded of their perpetual foreigner status may come to
   expect to be stereotyped in this manner. Our findings highlight the
   potentially deleterious effects of such expectations, even when the
   stereotypical or prejudicial reactions are relatively subtle and
   ambiguous in nature.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

   Despite the ethnic diversity of the samples in these studies, all
   studies used data from undergraduate university students, who represent
   only a small sub-set of the American population. However, it can be
   argued that if effects of the perpetual foreigner stereotype can be
   seen among a well-educated, successful population of individuals, the
   phenomenon may be even more magnified in other sub-sets of the American
   population. These other sub-sets should be sampled in order to
   determine their level of awareness of being denied the American
   identity, and whether such awareness is predictive of identity
   conflict, a lowered sense of belonging to mainstream America, and poor
   psychological adjustment, as it is for Asian American, Latino/a, and
   African American undergraduate students.

   A second limitation of the current research is its correlational
   nature. Despite establishing the predictive validity (in the regression
   sense) of the perpetual foreigner stereotype, it is impossible based on
   the present set of findings to make claims as to whether one's
   awareness of being seen as a foreigner is the cause of internal
   conflict, a lowered sense of belonging to mainstream America, and poor
   psychological adjustment. Future experimental or longitudinal research
   is needed to establish this causal relationship. In addition, future
   studies should examine moderators, such as ethnic identity, social
   support, and ethnic and mainstream American social networks, that may
   serve as buffers in the negative link between individuals' awareness of
   the perpetual foreigner stereotype and their psychological well-being.

CONCLUSION

   Equality is a core American value, yet when ethnic minorities perceive
   that their national identity is being denied via marginalizing comments
   (e.g., You speak English so well), they are being told that they are
   not as American as European Americans, whose "Americanness" is not
   called into question. Thus, comments and behaviors that subtly alienate
   ethnic minorities may perpetuate the commonly held belief (implicit and
   explicit) that Americanness is Whiteness (Devos & Banaji, 2005; Phinney
   et al., 1997). Although the intentions of the perpetrator are unknown,
   our studies show the importance of the target's perception of such
   exclusionary experiences. We have demonstrated that these repeated
   experiences of marginalization, although subtle, are linked to
   important psychological outcomes for the targets. Specifically, the
   most important contribution of the present studies is the
   identification of the potential impact of the awareness of the
   perpetual foreigner stereotype on one's identity and psychological
   adjustment. Our results suggest that the simple awareness of being seen
   as less American may influence an individual's adjustment and the way
   he/she perceives him/herself. In addition to establishing a foundation
   upon which to further examine the potentially negative consequences of
   the perpetual foreigner stereotype for ethnic minorities, the present
   research provides insight into how an underlying exclusionary national
   mindset may have nontrivial implications for minority groups' identity
   and well-being.

APPENDIX

Awareness of the Perpetual Foreigner Stereotype Scale

    1. Most people see me as an American.*
    2. Most people have difficulty viewing me as an American.
    3. I do not fit what people have in mind when they think of a typical
       American.
    4. Due to my ethnicity, people sometimes assume I am not American.
    5. Sometimes people think I am a foreigner.
    6. Based on my physical appearance, people assume I am American.*
    7. Because of how I speak, people sometimes think I am not a U.S.
       citizen.
    8. Sometimes people interpret what I do or say as if I was not
       American.
    9. When people look at me, they see a foreigner.
   10. My ethnic heritage sometimes disqualifies me as American.
   11. People sometimes ask me where I am from.
   12. People sometimes ask me how I speak English so well.
   13. I have to work harder than most people to be accepted as American.

Footnotes

   ^1In absolute terms, Latino/as (Studies 1 and 3) and African Americans
   reported relatively high rates of perceived discrimination, with group
   means well above the midpoint of the rating scale, suggesting that on
   average, they tend to perceive discrimination toward themselves and
   their group. However, none of the group means on the perpetual
   foreigner scale were above the midpoint. Thus, in absolute terms, none
   of the groups in Studies 1-3 reported being treated as perpetual
   foreigners to a great extent. Participants also reported low identity
   conflict (group means below the midpoint across the 3 studies) and high
   sense of belonging (group means above the midpoint across the 3
   studies). In terms of adjustment, Latino/a, and Asian American
   participants in Study 3 were relatively hopeful and satisfied with
   their lives (group means above the midpoint) and reported relatively
   few depression symptoms (group means below the midpoint).

   ^2In previous research, perceived discrimination predicted depression
   symptoms for Latino/as (e.g., Romero & Roberts, 2003; Smokowski &
   Bacallao, 2007); however, it was not a significant predictor of
   depression symptoms in Study 3 reported here. There may be important
   differences between our sample and the samples of Latino/as studied in
   previous research that may account for the difference in findings. For
   example, researchers have found that English language competence is
   another important predictor of fewer depression symptoms for Latino/a
   youth (e.g., Rumbaut, 1995). Because our sample consists of college
   students, they may be more competent in English than the adolescents
   typically studied in previous research, and this language competency
   may buffer the negative impact of perceived discrimination on
   depression symptoms for our sample.
