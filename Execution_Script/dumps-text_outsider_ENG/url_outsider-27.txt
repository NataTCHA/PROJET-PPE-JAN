   How to Build a Life

Find More Ways to Be an Outsider

   Doing so may feel painful, but it’s one of the best investments you
   will ever make.

   The world is full of outsiders: students away at a university far from
   home, immigrants to a new country, and people who go abroad for work or
   extended travel. Over the past year, more than 4.4 million American
   workers quit their jobs in the “Great Resignation,” and many of them
   became outsiders by joining a different company or moving to a new
   place, which they perhaps imagined might be friendlier to their
   personal needs and tastes.

   But just because a journey to the unfamiliar was voluntary doesn’t make
   it easy: Being an outsider can be lonely and difficult, especially if
   all the strangers around you seem to know and understand one another.
   Your instincts might tell you that uprooting yourself was a terrible
   decision, that the benefits you sought are much smaller than the costs
   you are bearing. You might even wonder if you’ll ever be happy again.

   The truth is, however, you almost certainly did not make a mistake.
   There is little evidence that being an outsider creates long-term
   problems for happiness or lowers your chance of success; on the
   contrary, people thrust between places and cultures tend to develop
   strength, flexibility, and resiliency. Being an outsider may be one of
   the best investments you will ever make, and you should embrace it,
   pain and all.

   Scholars have studied outsiders, including immigrants, refugees,
   students, and foreign workers, to understand the long-term effects on
   well-being and personal success. Some of the most illuminating work has
   focused on so-called third-culture kids (TCKs): children who grow up
   outside their parents’ home culture and, as a result, are influenced
   partially by their parents’ home culture and partially by the culture
   in which they live, but mostly relate to a “third culture” made up of
   fellow sojourners. The term was coined in the 1960s by the sociologists
   Ruth Hill Useem and John Useem in studies of people who grow up in, for
   example, missionary and military families.

   A lot of older theories of philosophy and psychiatry would predict
   tough outcomes for outsiders, especially TCKs—and indeed, would
   recommend against being one if you can avoid it. In Laws, Plato argued
   that people should not even travel abroad before age 40, and that
   visitors be restricted to port areas of cities to minimize their
   contact with citizens. He believed that acculturation—the psychological
   change that occurs when a person blends into an unfamiliar culture—was
   damaging to one’s sense of self. Plato’s reasoning carried on into the
   mid-20th century, and was shared by such eminent psychologists as
   Abraham Maslow, Erik Erikson, and Carl Rogers.

   Outsiders do tend to face particular genres of hardships, especially
   distrust by insiders. Despite the biblical injunction “Do not oppress a
   foreigner,” even believers often disregard friendliness in favor of
   tribal instinct when it comes to immigrants. You don’t have to move to
   a new place to feel the ill effects. People at the margins of society,
   by virtue of the language they speak or the lifestyle they choose,
   often bear the brunt of hostility. Joseph Stalin, for example, felt a
   particular animosity for the people he and his supporters called
   “rootless cosmopolitans”—generally, Jewish intellectuals, who he
   considered to live outside of mainstream Soviet society despite the
   fact that they lived in Soviet cities.

   However, with all due respect to Plato, outsiders can actually do very
   well. True, they generally suffer somewhat in the short term after a
   move. For example, one recent study showed that international college
   students rated their life satisfaction about 4 percent lower at the end
   of their first semester than at the beginning of the term. But a
   mountain of evidence shows that in the long run, being an outsider
   predicts well-being and emotional strength; it may even protect against
   depression.

   For example, one 2018 study in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology
   showed that TCKs grow up to be happier and more resilient than their
   peers who possess less multicultural experience, and are less prone to
   age-related declines in cognitive flexibility. A 2012 review found that
   being raised in at least two cultures leads, on average, to greater
   psychological and emotional well-being and higher social competence in
   adulthood. Also in 2013, scholars found that acculturation is
   negatively associated with depression, anxiety, psychological distress,
   and sadness.

   Furthermore, TCKs don’t usually wind up insecure; they develop multiple
   cultural identities that they employ flexibly, the same way they switch
   between languages. This is almost like a superpower in a globalized,
   fast-changing world.

   Spending time as an outsider is like any other big, taxing investment
   you can make in yourself: difficult and maybe painful, but with a
   positive, lifelong payoff. You might think of it as less like a fun
   vacation, and more akin to a voluntary personal challenge, like
   training for a triathlon. Here are a few ideas to incorporate an
   outsider ethos into your life.

1. Remember that being an outsider is a feature, not a bug.

   When you are new to a place or a group of people, you might be tempted
   to think of your unfamiliarity as a cost of doing business, and
   something to get over as quickly as possible. And by all means, you
   should make friends, learn the language, and find common ground. But
   don’t forget that the uncomfortable friction that occurs while you are
   integrating is making you stronger and more resilient. No pain, no
   gain.

2. Find regular ways to be an outsider.

   Given the benefits of bicultural experiences, don’t leave your outsider
   status up to circumstance. Find opportunities to be on the margins,
   looking in. In my profession of academia, for instance, we regularly
   take sabbaticals and go someplace completely new for a year or six
   months. Most people don’t have this luxury, but they can do something
   akin to it by changing jobs every few years, or transferring between
   cities. If that sounds too drastic, you can try switching up your
   regular haunts—go to a new church, club, or gym where you know no one.

3. Make friends with outsiders, even if you aren’t one.

   Remember that the third culture of TCKs is the one they form together
   as outsiders. Although no studies that I could find have looked at the
   therapeutic benefits of this third culture per se, it stands to reason
   that such bonding is crucial to the outsider’s superior adjustment
   capacity; it is a way to practice creating one’s own culture
   spontaneously. Even if you aren’t an outsider, you can learn these
   skills by joining those in your community who are. Look for the new
   people in your workplace or town, who are probably hanging out
   together. There’s always room for one more.

   In candor, I’m approaching this topic with a fair amount of bias. Being
   an outsider early in my adulthood was the most positive experience I
   have ever had. At 25, I moved to a foreign country where I didn’t speak
   a word of the language, and knew not one soul save for a woman I hoped
   to marry, but who spoke little English. It was brutal, but
   life-changing in the best way. After a few years, I had lost my fear of
   new things, whether it was an unfamiliar language, working with
   strangers, new love, or a community hostile to foreigners.

   That woman became my wife, and subsequently became an outsider in the
   United States. Over the past 30 years we have moved many times, as have
   our now-adult TCKs. Our youngest, who is adopted from China, attended
   three high schools during an especially peripatetic period in our
   family, and then chose a college in Pamplona, Spain. The changes were
   hard at first, but she is flourishing, just as the data would predict.
