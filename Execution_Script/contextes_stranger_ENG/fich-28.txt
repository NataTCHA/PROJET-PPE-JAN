   Love From a Stranger is an adaptation by Agatha Christie and Frank
   Vosper which draws both on Christie's earlier play, The Stranger, and
   her short story, Philomel Cottage. Some years before this play,
   Christie herself wrote a stage version, calling it The Stranger. Love
   from a Stranger opened at the New Theatre (now Noël Coward) in the West
   End in 1936. It was then reworked for film a year later, starring Ann
   Harding and Basil Rathbone. The play was then televised in 1938, live
   on BBC Television. When the story was adapted for the American
   half-hour radio programme Suspense it starred Orson Welles as Gerald.
   2018 welcomes a new UK tour of Love From a Stranger. Find out more.
