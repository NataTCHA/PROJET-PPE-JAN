   The art of children, psychiatric patients and prisoners who create art
   outwith the conventional structures of art training and art production
   is often categorised as outsider art. In 1964 the French artist Jean
   Dubuffet started to collect artworks he considered to be free from
   societal constraints. This was termed art brut (raw art) – another term
   for outsider art – and in 1948 he founded the Compagnie de L’Art Brut
   with André Breton.

   The artist Ben Nicholson discovered the naïve painter Alfred Wallis in
   St Ives in the 1920s. A retired fisherman, Wallis painted pictures of
   ships and the town harbour on pieces of driftwood and cardboard.
