   Anna Zemánková, No title, 1960s

   Outsider art is art made by self-taught or supposedly naïve artists
   with typically little or no contact with the conventions of the art
   worlds. In many cases, their work is discovered only after their
   deaths. Often, outsider art illustrates extreme mental states,
   unconventional ideas, or elaborate fantasy worlds.

   The term outsider art was coined in 1972 as the title of a book by art
   critic Roger Cardinal.^[1] It is an English equivalent for art brut
   (French: [aʁ bʁyt], "raw art" or "rough art"), a label created in the
   1940s by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside
   the boundaries of official culture. Dubuffet focused particularly on
   art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as
   examples psychiatric hospital patients, hermits, and
   spiritualists.^[2]^[3]

   Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an
   annual Outsider Art Fair^[4] has taken place in New York since 1993,
   and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to
   the subject. The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing
   label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream "art
   world" or "art gallery system", regardless of their circumstances or
   the content of their work.^[5] A more specific term, "outsider music",
   was later adapted for musicians.

Art of the mentally ill[edit]

   See also: Creativity and mental illness

   Interest in the art of the mentally ill, along with that of children
   and the makers of "peasant art", was first demonstrated by "Der Blaue
   Reiter" group: Wassily Kandinsky, August Macke, Franz Marc, Alexej von
   Jawlensky, and others. What the artists perceived in the work of these
   groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of
   sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first
   and only issue of their publication, Der Blaue Reiter Almanac. During
   World War I, Macke was killed at Champagne in 1914 and Marc was killed
   at Verdun in 1916; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent
   filled by Paul Klee, who continued to draw inspiration from these
   'primitives'.

   Interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the
   1920s. In 1921, Dr. Walter Morgenthaler published his book Ein
   Geisteskranker als Künstler (A Psychiatric Patient as Artist) about
   Adolf Wölfli, a psychotic mental patient in his care. Wölfli had
   spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him.
   His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in
   which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages,
   1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work.
   Wölfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which
   were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the Adolf Wölfli
   Foundation in the Museum of Fine Art, Bern.

   A defining moment was the publication of Bildnerei der Geisteskranken
   (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) in 1922, by Hans Prinzhorn. This was the
   first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of
   thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art
   collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time,
   including Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Jean Dubuffet.^[6]

   People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established
   artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be
   institutionalized. For example, William Kurelek, later awarded the
   Order of Canada for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted
   to the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated for
   schizophrenia.^[7] In the hospital he painted, producing The Maze, a
   dark depiction of his tortured youth.^[8] He was transferred from the
   Maudsley to Netherne Hospital from November 1953 to January 1955, to
   work with Edward Adamson (1911–1996), a pioneer of art therapy, and
   creator of the Adamson Collection.

Jean Dubuffet and art brut[edit]

   View inside the Collection de l'art brut museum, Lausanne

   French artist Jean Dubuffet was particularly struck by Bildnerei der
   Geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art, which he
   called art brut or raw art. In 1948 he formed the Compagnie de l'Art
   Brut along with other artists, including André Breton and Claude
   Lévi-Strauss.^[9] The collection he established became known as the
   Collection de l'art brut and the curator was Slavko Kopač for almost
   three decades.^[10] It contains thousands of works and is now
   permanently housed in Lausanne, Switzerland.

   Dubuffet characterized art brut as:

     Those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic
     creative impulses – where the worries of competition, acclaim and
     social promotion do not interfere – are, because of these very
     facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a
     certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted
     feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we
     cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural
     art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a
     fallacious parade.

          — Jean Dubuffet, "Place à l'incivisme" (December 1987 – February
          1988).^[11] Dubuffet's writing on art brut was the subject of a
          noted program at the Art Club of Chicago in the early 1950s.

   Dubuffet argued that 'culture', that is mainstream culture, managed to
   assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away
   whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine
   expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut
   was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and
   assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to
   be assimilated.

   Dubuffet’s championing of Art Brut would not last long. Scholars argue
   Dubuffet’s distaste for the mainstream art world helped ensure that art
   brut and the Compagnie de l'Art Brut would not survive on a commercial
   basis. Dubuffet would kill art brut as he defined it in his quest for
   its authenticity.^[9] Three years after the Compagnie de l'Art Brut was
   formed, Dubuffet dissolved it, caving to form the more conventional
   Collection de l'art brut afterward.^[9]

Cultural context[edit]

   The interest in "outsider" practices among twentieth-century artists
   and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection
   of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part
   of the 20th century gave rise to Cubism and the Dada, Constructivist
   and Futurist movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic
   movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist Marcel Duchamp,
   for example, abandoned "painterly" technique to allow chance operations
   a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to
   recontextualize existing "ready-made" objects as art. Mid-century
   artists, including Pablo Picasso, looked outside the traditions of high
   culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of "primitive"
   societies, the unschooled art made by children, and vulgar advertising
   graphics. Dubuffet's championing of the art brut – of the insane and
   others at the margins of society – is yet another example of
   avant-garde art challenging established cultural values. As with
   analysis of these other art movements, current discourse indicates art
   brut is innately tied to primitivism^[9]^[12] due to its similarity in
   its borrowing of personal "de-patriation" and exoticization of familiar
   yet alien forms.

   Two images of Joe Minter's African Village in America, a half-acre
   visionary art environment in Birmingham, Alabama. Scenes include
   African warriors watching their descendants’ struggles in Alabama,
   tributes to black scientists and military leaders, recreations of the
   epic civil rights confrontations in Alabama, and biblical scenes.

   A number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood
   as "outside" of official culture. Definitions of these terms vary and
   overlap.^[13] The editors of Raw Vision, a leading journal in the
   field, suggest that "Whatever views we have about the value of
   controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by
   way of an agreed vocabulary". Consequently, they lament the use of
   "outsider artist" to refer to almost any untrained artist. "It is not
   enough to be untrained, clumsy or naïve. Outsider Art is virtually
   synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of
   art produced by those who do not know its name."
     * Art Brut: Coined by Jean Dubuffet, the term translated literally
       from French means "raw art".^[2]^[3] 'Raw' is analogous in that it
       has not been through the academic 'cooking' process: i.e. the world
       of art schools, galleries, and museums. Dubuffet’s original
       definition pertains strictly to the ‘raw art’ created by the
       autodidactic and shunned fringes of society.^[9]
     * Folk art: Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative
       skills associated with peasant communities in Europe – though
       presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has
       broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and
       decorative skill – everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap
       buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that
       folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values,
       where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to
       society's mainstream.
     * Intuitive art/Visionary art: Raw Vision Magazine's preferred
       general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate
       umbrella terms. However, visionary art, unlike other definitions
       here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which
       includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art
       is probably the most general term available. Intuit: The Center for
       Intuitive and Outsider Art based in Chicago operates a museum
       dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider
       art. The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is
       dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art.
     * Marginal art/Art singulier: Essentially the same as Neuve
       Invention; refers to artists on the margins of the art world.
     * Naïve art: Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who
       aspire to "normal" artistic status, i.e. they have a much more
       conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do
       outsider artists.
     * Neuve invention: Used to describe artists who, although marginal,
       have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing
       art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet
       too; strictly speaking, it refers only to a special part of the
       Collection de l'art brut.
     * Visionary environments: Buildings and sculpture parks built by
       visionary artists – ranging from decorated houses to large areas
       incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a
       tightly associated theme. Examples include Watts Towers by Simon
       Rodia, Buddha Park and Sala Keoku by Bunleua Sulilat, and The
       Palais Ideal by Ferdinand Cheval.
