   Indonesia's parliament passed a law banning sex outside of marriage for
   citizens and foreigners alike.

   The law, which will take effect in three years upon the adoption of a
   new criminal code, sentences offenders to one year in prison, while
   those found cohabiting can face six months, according to the Associated
   Press, which obtained a copy of the new law code. Sex outside of
   marriage was already banned, but the punishment was light and almost
   never enforced. The strict new laws come amid an upsurge in religious
   conservatism in the world's most populous Muslim country.

   Though widely criticized by human rights activists, the new code was
   hailed by the government and its supporters as a monumental
   achievement.

   “It turns out that it is not easy for us to break away from colonial
   living legacy, even though this nation no longer wants to use colonial
   products,” Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly said in a news
   conference. “Finalizing this process demonstrates that even 76 years
   after the Dutch Criminal Code was adopted as the Indonesian Criminal
   Code, it is never too late to produce laws on our own. The Criminal
   Code is a reflection of the civilization of a nation.”

   The new criminal code also bans insulting the president or vice
   president, state institutions, and national ideology. Contraception and
   blasphemy, as well as their promotion, are also banned. Oddly enough,
   despite the strict new laws regarding a wide variety of social issues,
   the new code is more liberal than the old in terms of LGBT rights and
   abortion.

   Human rights activists expressed worry over abuses from the new laws,
   particularly regarding premarital sex and cohabitation. Some worry that
   millions of married couples without proper marriage licenses could be
   subject to imprisonment, according to the BBC. Other business leaders
   feared that the ban on extramarital sex could harm tourism.

   Ajeng, a woman who has lived with her partner outside of marriage for
   the past five years, expressed her worries to the outlet, adding that
   she believes the new laws are draconian in nature.

   "People are angry that their liberty is being taken. Indonesia has
   plenty of problems like poverty, climate change, and corruption, but
   instead of solving a problem they've created a bill that only adds to
   the problem," she said.
