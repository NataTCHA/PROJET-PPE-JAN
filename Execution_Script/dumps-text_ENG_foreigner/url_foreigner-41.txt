     * About INED
       The French Institute for Demographic Studies or INED, is a public
       research institute specialized in population studies that works in
       partnership with the academic and research communities at national
       and international levels.
          + Who we are
            INED was founded in 1945, and in 1986 it acquired the status
            of an Etablissement Public à Caractère Scientifique et
            Technologique (EPST), meaning that it is under joint
            administrative supervision of the "Ministère de l’enseignement
            supérieur et de la recherche", of the "Ministère de la santé
            et de la prévention et du Ministère des solidarités, de
            l’autonomie et des personnes handicapées". The Institute’s
            missions are to study the populations of France and other
            countries, to ensure wide dissemination of the knowledge
            thereby acquired, and to provide training in research through
            research. INED’s approach to demography is resolutely open and
            interdisciplinary, implicating a wide range of disciplines
            including economics, history, geography, sociology,
            anthropology, biology and epidemiology. With its research
            units, the Institute promotes communication and exchange
            within the scientific community and between researchers and
            the general public while conducting numerous European and
            international research projects.
               o Our history
               o Our remit
                 In 1986, INED became one of France’s eight public
                 scientific and technical institutions (EPST), alongside
                 CNRS, INSERM, INRA and the IRD (Institut de Recherche
                 pour le Développement). The Institute’s overall missions
                 are to study all aspects of population, to provide
                 training in and through research, to keep the government,
                 public authorities and general public informed about
                 demographic questions and to disseminate French
                 demographic research internationally.

          + Surveys
            INED designs and carries out its own surveys. The data thus
            collected are accessible to the entire scientific community.
            The Institute has its own survey office, which defines
            sampling methods, assists in designing questionnaires and
            drawing up data collection protocols, and adjusts statistical
            samples. It is also in charge of making anonymized data
            available to others. INED’s survey catalogue and a description
            of the projects in progress may be consulted on line.

       website users, including the INED library, open to all and
       accessible on line; and presentations of statistical analysis and
       survey methods.
          + Statistical Methodology
            Research relies on a wide range of statistical analysis
            methods to process survey data and to describe and model
            demographic events and phenomena on the basis of that data.
            Alongside classic methods such as data analysis and logistic
            regression, several other methods have come to the fore in the
            last 30 years.

          + Survey Methodology
            Each survey is specific but all surveys include a number of
            requisite steps and phases. Important factors to be taken into
            account from the outset include survey protocol, sampling
            frame, budget, regulations, questionnaire testing, data file
            compilation, and quality assessment. INED’s Surveys Department
            handles most of the data collection procedures involved in
            INED research projects. It may assist with data production
            throughout the process or provide help on particular survey
            phases only.
               o Procedures
               o Methodological choices
                 Every INED survey is designed to investigate a particular
                 research question or set of questions. INED surveys are
                 “custom-made” and in many cases highly innovative.
                 Methodological choices are therefore a key phase of the
                 research. The time required to prepare the survey, design
                 questions, conduct and assess pilot surveys and, later,
                 to evaluate the quality of the data collected must not be
                 underestimated.

               o Bioethics
                 Recent social and medical advances implicated in
                 contemporary bioethics issues have generated many new
                 research topics. Several innovative research projects,
                 surveys, and scientific articles are now contributing new
                 knowledge on subjects such as assisted reproduction
                 technology (ART), surrogacy, and end-of-life. As the
                 French parliament examines a new bioethics bill, INED
                 will be presenting a set of resources and material here
                 that shed scientific light on several major bioethics
                 topics.

     * Publications
       INED Publications has been in existence since the Institute’s
       founding in 1945, consistent with one of its fundamental missions:
       to disseminate scientific knowledge. INED Publications reflects and
       enacts the Institute’s commitment to multi-disciplinarity in
       demographic research by diffusing and promoting scientific
       production and survey results and findings to a diverse audience,
       thereby making solid scientific expertise and knowledge available
       for public debate on major social issues. Recently, the Open
       Archive has widened diffusion of free-access published materials
       while ensuring the continued preservation of INED researchers’
       studies.

                      départements (DOMs). These figures do not include
                      Mayotte, which became the fifth DOM on 31 March
                      2011, or the overseas territories and collectivities
                      (New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Saint Barthélémy,
                      Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and
                      Futuna). INSEE includes the DOMs in its annual
                      demographic overview and in most of the tables in
                      its detailed annual study of the demographic
                      situation in France.

                    # Population structure
                      The population of France by sex and age is estimated
                      by INSEE each year. A provisional estimate is first
                      issued and final figures are published at a later
                      date. Censuses are conducted in certain years to
                      enumerate the population. The population estimates
                      are adjusted on the basis of census data, for the
                      whole of France and for the different départements
                      and regions.

                    # Population change
                      The population changes from one year to the next.
                      Natural change is the difference between births and
                      deaths, and can be determined precisely from vital
                      records. Net migration is the difference between the
                      number of immigrants and the number of emigrants. It
                      is estimated on the basis of available statistics.
                      Adjustments are sometimes made to establish overall
                      consistency between census population figures and
                      inter-census estimates of population change. To
                      estimate its relative scale, population change is
                      often expressed in relation to the mean population
                      of a given year. Rates of birth, death, natural
                      increase and total variation are obtained in this
                      way.

                    # Births, fertility
                      Registered births are recorded in statistical
                      bulletins which provide a rich source of
                      information. Births are counted on the basis of many
                      different characteristics: parents’ marital status
                      and nationality, sex of the child, twin births, etc.
                      Information on the mother’s age is used to calculate
                      annual fertility indicators, such as the total
                      fertility rate expressed as a total number of
                      children per woman. Completed cohort fertility is
                      also calculated every year. For example, women born
                      in 1970 were 34 years old in 2004. We know how many
                      children they have had before age 34 and we can
                      estimate how many children they will have during
                      their reproductive life.

                    # Abortion, contraception
                      Fertility can be controlled by means of
                      contraception and induced abortion. Information on
                      contraceptive practice in France is obtained through
                      surveys conducted regularly by INED since 1978 among
                      the entire female population. The number of induced
                      abortions is estimated on the basis of abortion
                      notifications and hospital statistics. INED is
                      responsible for publication of abortion statistics.

                    # Marriages, divorces, Civil Unions (Pacs)
                      Marriage registers provide a rich source of
                      information on marriage practices: number of
                      marriages, previous marital status and nationality
                      of spouses, etc. Statistics on divorces and civil
                      unions (PACS) are supplied by the Ministry of
                      Justice.

                    # Couples, households, families
                      The first task in a population census is to
                      enumerate dwellings. Persons living in the same
                      dwelling form a household, so each household
                      comprises all the persons living in a single
                      dwelling. According to the census definitions, a
                      household may comprise one or more families. A
                      family is a group of persons comprising a couple
                      with no children, a couple with children, or one
                      adult and his/her children.

                         @ Children of families
                    # Deaths, causes of mortality
                      Death registers provide a means to measure
                      variations in mortality. Deaths by sex and age are
                      used to construct life tables which give life
                      expectancy at birth, i.e. the number of years a
                      newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of
                      mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the
                      same throughout its life. The mortality of children
                      under the age of one year is also specifically
                      calculated. When a person dies, a doctor records the
                      cause of death on a death certificate which is sent
                      to INSERM where all causes of death are coded.

                    # International Migration
                      Two statistical series drawing on different sources
                      are presented. INSEE uses annual census surveys that
                      provide an overview of net migration and entries and
                      departures of non-immigrants and immigrants
                      (including undocumented foreigners). INED,
                      meanwhile, counts the number of non-EU foreigners
                      admitted who have obtained an initial residence
                      permit of at least one year (AGDREF file, French
                      Interior Ministry).

                    # Immigrants and immigrant descendants
                      Population censuses provide an opportunity to count
                      the number of inhabitants who were born outside
                      France. Among foreign-born inhabitants, a
                      distinction is generally made between persons born
                      with French nationality and immigrants, who are born
                      with a different nationality. Inhabitants are
                      distinguished by their nationality, i.e. French or
                      foreign and, among French citizens, those who were
                      born French and those who have been naturalized. The
                      census provides information on current nationality
                      and nationality at birth. Foreigners and immigrants
                      form two different categories. Immigrants "born
                      abroad as a foreign national" may still be
                      foreigners at the time of the census or may have
                      become French. Foreigners, for their part, may have
                      been born abroad (in which case they are immigrants)
                      or in France (in which case they are not
                      immigrants).

                 This section provides data tables on populations, births
                 and deaths in Europe and in developed countries. It also
                 includes indicators of population change (birth and death
                 rates) and the two main demographic indicators: the total
                 fertility rate and life expectancy at birth.
