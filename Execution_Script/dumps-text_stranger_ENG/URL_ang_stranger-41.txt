In ‘Strangers to Ourselves,’ a Revelatory Account of Mental Illness

   For her first book, the New Yorker writer Rachel Aviv probes her own
   and others’ lives to suggest how the stories we are told by the medical

   STRANGERS TO OURSELVES
   Unsettled Minds and the Stories That Make Us
   By Rachel Aviv
   276 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Rachel Aviv was 6 years old when she was hospitalized for not eating.
   She was so young that she had never encountered the word “anorexia”
   before; it sounded to her like a kind of dinosaur.

   Her doctors decided that she should be kept with the older girls with
   eating disorders, who taught her how to exercise obsessively and
   treated her like an “anorexic-in-training.” But Aviv soon started
   eating again and quickly lost interest in depriving herself of the food
   she had previously refused even to talk about (pronouncing the words
   had felt the same to her as consuming them). A year later, she would
   confide in her diary, “I had some thing that was a siknis its cald
   anexorea.” She explained that she had anorexia “because I want to be
   someone better than me.”

   It’s a startling passage in the prologue of “Strangers to Ourselves,”
   but like so many of the stories in this intimate and revelatory book,
   the truth of it is real but incomplete. As an adult, having written a
   number of stories about people in extremis for The New Yorker, Aviv has
   come to “question whatever basic feelings existed in me before they
   were called anorexia.” Her medical records failed to present a
   “coherent picture” of why she stopped eating and drinking, but that
   didn’t stop the doctors from issuing diagnostic proclamations. “The
   original experience couldn’t be captured or understood on its own
   terms,” she writes, “and gradually became something that wasn’t
   entirely of our own making.”

   By “our” Aviv is referring to the other people in her book. There’s
   Ray, who sued an elite psychiatric hospital that prided itself on its
   psychoanalytic approach for failing to make him better; Bapu, a wealthy
   Brahmin mother of two who repeatedly left her family in Chennai, India,
   to pursue the ascetic life of a mystic; Naomi, who was incarcerated for
   second-degree murder after throwing herself and her twin babies into
   the Mississippi River; and Laura, a Harvard graduate from a well-to-do
   family, who had been prescribed psychiatric medications since she was a
   teenager and decided — years later — to see who she was without the
   drugs.

   We learn about these people one by one, with a chapter for each, so
   that Aviv can recount their lives in detail and therefore in full. She
   interviews doctors, friends and survivors; she reads her subjects’
   journals in order to get a grasp on how they explained themselves to
   themselves. Aside from her candid reflections in the prologue and the
   epilogue, Aviv mostly hangs back, even though her own experience primes
   us — as maybe it primed her — to be alert to how stories can clarify as
   well as distort the mental distress that a person is going through.

   Psychiatric explanations can be helpful and harmful, Aviv says. They
   pretend to a neutrality that can offer consolation but also
   condescension. Persistent colonial assumptions about the irrationality
   of Indian religions meant that some of Bapu’s doctors were disdainfully
   dismissive. “She was ugly,” one tells Aviv. “She was living like a
   witch, and looking like a witch.”

   In Naomi’s case, medications helped with her psychosis, but psychiatric
   evaluations were also used against her. Naomi, who is Black, said that
   she had dropped her babies into the river in order to save them from a
   life of “inferiority, indifference and ridicule” in a racist society.
   The psychiatrists who first evaluated Naomi after her arrest decided
   that even though she talked about an impending apocalypse and living in
   another dimension, her remarks about racism were too astute for her to
   meet the legal bar for insanity. But as her release date approached, 13
   years later, a psychiatrist concluded that she had not yet “achieved
   adequate stability”: “Now she was deemed unwell enough to be
   indefinitely detained,” Aviv writes.

   Aviv’s narrative is so attuned to subtlety and complexity that any
   summary risks making it sound like she’s doing something she’s not.
   This isn’t an anti-psychiatry book — Aviv is too aware of the specifics
   of any situation to succumb to anything so sweeping and polemical. What
   she does is recognize the multiplicity of stories that attach to her
   subjects’ experiences, exploring a variety of interpretations instead
   of jumping at the impulse to explain them away.

   “Strangers to Ourselves” delicately balances two truths that prove
   remarkably difficult to hold in tandem. We all have our own minds, our
   own experiences, our own suffering; we are also social creatures who
   live among others, and social forces have at least some bearing on how
   we understand who we are. Aviv suggests that we continue to cling to
   reductive theories about brain chemistry because “the reality — that
   mental illness is caused by an interplay between biological, genetic,
   psychological and environmental factors — is more difficult to
   conceptualize.”

   Psychiatrists talk a lot about “insight,” or what one defined as “the
   correct attitude to a morbid change in oneself.” Aviv points out the
   professional presumption baked into the term, as if insight is supposed
   to measure “the degree to which a patient agrees with his or her
   doctor’s interpretation.” Aviv, for her part, finds more resonance in
   Keats’s notion of “negative capability” — the capacity to experience
   “uncertainty, mysteries and doubts, without any irritable reaching
   after facts or reason.” She admits how hard it is for her to sustain
   such patience for her own anxieties and preoccupations, but “Strangers
   to Ourselves” is a book-length demonstration of Aviv’s extraordinary
   ability to hold space for the “uncertainty, mysteries and doubts” of
   others.

   Looking back on her hospitalization three decades ago, Aviv remains
   haunted by what happened to another girl in the ward, named Hava, who
   died in her early 40s from complications of bulimia. In her journals,
   the 12-year-old Hava showed plenty of insight about her condition,
   referring frequently to her “chemical imbalances,” whereas the
   6-year-old Aviv “had basically none.”

   But perhaps it was this lack of insight — “I never felt stuck in a
   particular story that others had created for me” — that made Aviv’s
   diagnosis feel more malleable to her, allowing her to pursue other
   possibilities. The divide between her fate and Hava’s was enormous but
   also porous. “There are stories that save us, and stories that trap
   us,” Aviv writes, “and in the midst of an illness it can be very hard
   to know which is which.”
