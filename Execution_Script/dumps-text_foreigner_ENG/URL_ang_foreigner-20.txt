Defining 'Foreign Born' and 'Foreigner' in International Migration Statistics

   Contrary to popular belief, numbers are not always "just numbers." As
   social scientists point out, many official statistics released by
   government agencies reflect the culture and history of the country in
   which they are generated. All aspects of a data collection system—from
   what data are collected, to the questions asked on surveys and
   censuses, even to what data are ultimately analyzed and
   disseminated—are influenced by this same context. Thus, official
   statistics actually embody socio-cultural influences that can prove to
   be problematic when attempting to compare data from different
   countries.

   Like other official numbers, international migration statistics also
   reflect the culture and history of the country in which they are
   generated. Throughout the world, countries demarcate their national
   identities by defining what seem to be immutable migration-related
   concepts, such as "migrant," "immigrant," or "citizen," in distinct
   ways. This variability has a direct impact on the way the governments
   of those countries collect, process, and present migration data—and on
   the ability of data users to make direct comparisons among countries.

   Models of Citizenship: Jus Soli and Jus Sanguinis

   The influence of socio-cultural norms and historical experiences on
   migration statistics is best illustrated in the similar-yet-different
   concepts of "foreign born" and "foreigner," both of which are rooted in
   and reflect very different models of citizenship. In general, the
   majority of people around the world acquire citizenship in one of two
   ways: "by birth" (jus soli) or "by blood" (jus sanguinis). Although
   these are "ideal types," they remain useful in explaining the divergent
   outcomes of citizenship policies. In a jus soli system, citizenship is
   based on place of birth. Although there are exceptions to this rule, in
   general, people born in these countries are citizens, while people born
   outside are non-citizens. Thus, in a jus soli context, the term
   "foreign born" refers to residents of a country who were born in
   another country. Foreign-born residents can, under certain
   circumstances, change their status and become citizens through
   naturalization. When combined, both place of birth and citizenship
   status can be used to divide the population into three
   categories—native-born citizens, foreign-born citizens, and
   non-citizens—and define who among the foreign born has acquired the
   full rights and responsibilities bestowed on all citizens.

   In a jus sanguinis system, descent and heritage play a pivotal role in
   defining who is, and can become, a citizen. Where people were born is
   not as important as if and how they can trace their ancestry back to
   the origin country. In this context, the term "foreigner" refers to
   those in the population whose heritage cannot be traced back to the
   host country. In general, under jus sanguinis citizenship policies, it
   is often difficult—though not impossible—for foreigners to naturalize,
   even if they are long-term residents or were native born to the
   country. Those foreigners who do naturalize typically have to
   demonstrate that they meet the required "integration" criteria, such as
   language skills or knowledge of the country's culture and history.
   While it is often difficult for resident foreigners to naturalize, it
   is usually easier for foreign-born ethnics to obtain citizenship after
   immigrating back to their ancestral "homeland," in some cases even if
   their families have lived abroad for generations. In this sense, the
   concept of foreigner divides a country's resident population—and,
   indeed, the world's population—into two groups: nationals, who have the
   right of citizenship by virtue of their ancestry, and foreigners, who
   must earn the right to naturalize.

   Foreign Born v. Foreigner: Reflecting Alternative Views of Citizenship

   These outlines of jus soli and jus sanguinis citizenship policies are,
   as noted, ideal types. In fact, most countries, while generally
   emphasizing one or the other, have increasingly blurred the distinction
   between the two by including elements of both in their broader
   procedures. However, the preeminence of either a "by birth" or "by
   blood" citizenship policy simultaneously reflects and defines how a
   country views "membership" and who does, and does not, belong. This, in
   turn, influences how individuals in a country's population are
   classified administratively and how they are counted in official
   statistics.

   The influence of varying citizenship policies on migration statistics
   can be clearly seen when data from the United States and Germany are
   put side-by-side. Two examples will be presented here, with the first
   focusing on "stock" data and the other on "flow" data. Both the United
   States and Germany data discussed in these examples are available in
   The Source's Global Data Center.

   [insight_USfbpop.gif] Stock data represent "snapshots" of a population
   at a single point in time by counting (as in a census) or estimating
   (as in a survey) the distribution of that population according to some
   characteristic, such as age, income, or sex. An example of stock data
   would be the distribution of all foreign persons in a population by
   their country of origin. However, who is included in the category of
   "foreign persons" will depend on whether the dominant citizenship
   policy of a country is jus soli or jus sanguinis.

   In the United States, where the citizenship policy is predominantly jus
   soli, "foreign persons" refers to all foreign born in the resident
   population and includes both naturalized citizens and non-citizens. In
   Germany, where a jus sanguinis policy dominates, "foreign persons"
   generally refers to anyone in the resident population who is a
   non-citizen and not of German descent, that is, both foreign-born and
   native-born foreigners who have not naturalized. However, it does not
   include either ethnic Germans who were born abroad and were awarded
   citizenship after immigration or non-German foreign-born persons who
   have naturalized; these individuals are considered to be, or to have
   become, nationals. As a result, while the concepts of foreign born and
   foreigner initially appear similar, they actually categorize people in
   fundamentally different ways. This makes it difficult to compare
   directly the migration stock data of the United States and Germany.
   [insight_GerForPop.gif]

   A similar problem exists when attempting to compare flow data. Flow
   data are collected and produced by governmental administrative
   agencies. Unlike stock data, they are collected continuously but are
   usually presented in an aggregate form for a point in time, such as
   monthly or annual statistics. A good example of flow data is the number
   of immigrants entering a country, since immigration is a process that
   occurs continuously and is catalogued year-round. Depending on whether
   the citizenship policy of a country is predominantly jus soli or jus
   sanguinis, the term "immigrant" can include very different categories
   of people.

   In the United States, immigrant inflow data include foreign-born
   persons who are non-citizens entering the country for lawful permanent
   residence. In Germany, immigrant inflow data also include foreign-born
   persons who are non-citizens entering the country legally, but not all
   foreign born are considered immigrants. Specifically, Aussiedler, or
   ethnic Germans born in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, who
   meet certain requirements, have the right to enter Germany virtually as
   citizens. While they are enumerated in the inflow data, the Aussiedler
   are not considered immigrants but rather "returning nationals." This
   orientation also helps to explain why German citizens who have returned
   to Germany after long-term stays abroad are also included in the inflow
   data. In the United States, immigrant inflow data documents the arrival
   of the foreign born, while in Germany it documents both the arrival of
   the foreign population and the "return" of ethnic nationals.

   Implications for the Comparability of International Migration Data

   While it is generally assumed that statistics passively and objectively
   reflect the event or process they measure, in reality, they do so
   subjectively—in the context of the history and culture of the society
   in which they are produced. These socio-cultural influences can be seen
   in the varied concepts, legal definitions, and administrative
   classifications used to generate and report migration data— and this
   variation means that international migration statistics are often
   difficult to compare. Concepts and terms that may initially appear to
   include the same categories of people, such as "foreign born" and
   "foreigner" or even "immigrant," may actually encompass very different
   groups. This means that the rate and trend statistics generated from
   these data, such as "percentage of foreign persons in the total
   population" or "annual number of immigrants," are often not directly
   comparable.

   Do these differences mean that comparative analyses of international
   migration trends and levels should not be pursued? Of course not.
   Fortunately, many governments recognize the problems associated with
   these differences and, encouraged by support from various international
   agencies, are moving their statistics in the direction of greater
   comparability. However, change takes time and, as of today, there are
   still migration-related concepts and terms that remain problematic in
   an international context. It is therefore essential for users to be
   aware of the existence of differences and to make every effort to
   understand how those differences affect the comparability of the data.
   This is important, because it is the degree of comparability that will
   determine the qualifications associated with any conclusions drawn.
