   WASHINGTON

   Most Americans "feel like a stranger" in their own country, according
   to a poll.

   Axios/Survey Monkey poll showed that 60% of adults said they agreed
   that "things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in
   my own country."

   Of 2,811 respondents, 24% said they "completely agree" and 36% said
   they "mostly agree" with the statement.

   The poll also found that 67% of those polled were angry about the way
   things are going in the country. As well, 62% found themselves feeling
   angry about current events and the news.

   More than half of the respondents, or 59%, said things in the U.S. are
   now headed in the wrong direction.

   The respondents were also asked to respond to the way U.S. President
   Donald Trump is handling his job, with 54% disapproved while 44%
   approved.

   The poll was conducted from Oct. 17 - 20, nearly a week before House
   Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry following claims by a
   whistle-blower that the president sought to pressure Ukraine to
   interfere in the 2020 presidential elections.

   In a July 25 telephone call, Trump repeatedly pressed Ukraine President
   Volodymyr Zelensky to launch a probe into former U.S. Vice President
   Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, a businessman, over unsubstantiated
   corruption allegations.

   The elder Biden is a leading candidate in the race for the Democratic
   nomination to challenge Trump for the presidency in 2020.

   Trump, a Republican, has accused Democrats of time-wasting and says the
   House inquiry amounts to a “lynching,” maintaining he did nothing
   wrong.
