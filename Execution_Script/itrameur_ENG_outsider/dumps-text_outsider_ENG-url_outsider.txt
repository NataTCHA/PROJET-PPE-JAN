   It is rare that a couture house is better known for what it does today
   than what it did a century ago. Dior, Chanel and Balenciaga are among
   the famous Parisian fashion labels to tap into their significant
   couture heritage to validate what they do now. However, Elsa
   Schiaparelli, who founded her maison in 1927 and shuttered it in 1954
   after accruing large debts, is far less well-known.

   Having lain dormant for 60 years, Schiaparelli was relaunched amid much
   excitement in 2012 by Italian fashion tycoon Diego Della Valle,
   chairman of Tod’s Group. Fabled guest designer Christian Lacroix was
   enlisted to create the initial collection, which was presented in
   Schiaparelli’s lovingly restored headquarters at 21, Place Vendome.

   However, it wasn’t until American singer Lady Gaga appeared in a
   spectacular custom-designed outfit to sing at President Biden’s
   inauguration that the Schiaparelli name truly registered on the radar
   of anyone outside the fashion world. The designer of that dress was
   Texan Daniel Roseberry, the thoughtful, quietly spoken son of an
   Anglican minister who was appointed creative director of the house of
   Schiaparelli in April 2019.

   Schiaparelli was a competitor of Gabrielle Chanel and one of the most
   revered fashion names in the first half of the 20th century. Her
   pioneering collaborations included tie-ups with surrealist artists such
   as Jean Cocteau, Man Ray and Salvador Dali. Her use of “shocking” pink
   and witty details including the shoe hat, lobster dress, trompe d’oeil
   tear dress and chest of drawer pocket details on tailoring are examples
   of her irreverent design vocabulary. These relationships are explored
   in Shocking! The Surreal World of Elsa Schiaparelli, an exhibition at
   the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris that opened this summer and will
   run until January 22.

   In only 25 years, Schiaparelli turned fashion into a natural expression
   of the avant garde. She embodied the vision of a bright and vibrant
   Paris, curious about everything and enjoying each novelty that came her
   way. In November 1934, Harper’s Bazaar pronounced her to be “the most
   daring and original talent in the French dressmaking world … with
   volcanic energy and a fantastically fecund sense of modern invention”.

   When she died in 1973, Cristobal Balenciaga proclaimed her “the only
   real artist in couture”. Yves Saint Laurent similarly observed: “When
   she died, chic closed her eyes.”

   Schiaparelli was not just a dressmaker, she was “a brand maker”,
   explains Roseberry, sitting in the almost bare white studio overlooking
   the bustling Place Vendome where he spent the weekends during the
   pandemic sketching alone, in what at the time felt like an abandoned
   city. He realises, in hindsight, that it was a privilege and an
   incredibly inspiring time to think about her heritage, almost as if the
   ghost of Schiaparelli was looking over his shoulder.

   “Her legacy is incredibly modern — the house is complicated because her
   work is specific and singular, but is still very relevant today,”
   Roseberry says, pointing out that relaunches of storied houses don’t
   always work. Like Vionnet, he suggests, who created a methodology about
   how to cut a garment rather than a lasting vision.

   Roseberry believes the exhibition at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs lays
   bare “Elsa’s contribution to fashion — she was the first person to
   cross fashion with pop culture, but with artists that were the pop
   culture of that time”.

   In a contemporary world, the creative dialogue between fashion and art
   has become almost commonplace, but Schiaparelli was the first to start
   that conversation. Perhaps because of her background, she was drawn
   into the bohemian world of artists.

   An aristocrat, she grew up in a Baroque palace in Italy surrounded by
   Italian renaissance and classical antiquity and, intellectually, that
   went on to be reflected in her collections. Her father was an academic
   who specialised in the Islamic world and Middle Ages, while her uncle
   was a renowned astronomer. Schiaparelli, therefore, felt far more
   comfortable in the company of artists than in the Parisian “society” of
   her time.

   She was an outsider, something that Roseberry can relate to coming to
   Paris as a little-known designer from Texas, who had spent 11 years
   working in New York at Thom Browne, a designer who himself likes to
   play with surrealist concepts. “I can see that there is a freedom to
   being an outsider that gives you permission to play by the rules or
   not,” Roseberry says. “I think there is something about this outsider’s
   perspective, where mastering something that you were not raised with
   gives you a different perspective.”

   The house has given him the freedom to be himself, and while constantly
   linking back to Schiaparelli, “there are also things that are uniquely
   and personally mine”, Roseberry says.

   He initially launched into her madcap world with moulded tailoring and
   an evaluation of how he would approach the figure, something that has
   been part of his creative process since enrolling for life drawing
   classes at the age of 16. This focus on silhouette also relates to the
   famous hourglass body of Schiaparelli’s signature perfume bottle for
   Shocking, with a tape measure creating a trompe l’oeil detail that
   Roseberry has since reproduced on jackets.

   However, it is the eye-catching jewellery featuring parts of the
   anatomy that has made people sit up and notice. His gold body castings,
   he admits, caused a visceral reaction in the fashion world. Referencing
   the oversized gilded jewellery of the 1930s, 1970s and 1980s, they
   include cast ears, eyes, teeth and nose jewellery, gold toes on black
   shoes and lung necklaces, which Bella Hadid famously wore with a
   scooped neckline dress to the Cannes Film Festival last year. They were
   the first surrealist tropes that could live in a modern environment —
   however, he is conscious that the joke can wear thin, so expect
   something fresh and different in seasons to come.

   Overall, Roseberry has taken a very restrained approach to the
   extraordinary legacy that Elsa Schiaparelli left behind.

   “It’s about wearing the heritage in the archives very lightly because
   they can become a great burden, I think. Visually they are so striking
   and so specific and it’s not even silhouette driven, it’s even more
   specific than that,” explains Roseberry.

   He wants to rouse the same thrill at seeing something new that
   Schiaparelli did in her day, without endlessly mimicking her work. “I
   don’t think that is what she would have wanted today.” The exhibition
   features not only Schiaparelli’s archives, but also the work of
   designers such as Azzedine Alaia and John Galliano, who were inspired
   by the couturier, and of course pieces from Roseberry’s collections,
   including autumn/winter 2022, which featured the black velvet corset
   and pants with hand-painted flowers that Cate Blanchett wore to the
   Venice Film Festival last month, and Lady Gaga’s famous inauguration
   outfit.

   Roseberry has only been at Schiaparelli three years, but beyond Lady
   Gaga, he has chalked up several memorable red carpet moments with stars
   such as Adele, Cardi B, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan. His
   personal favourite looks were Lady Gaga and Bella Hadid’s, along with
   the leather body-conscious dress Beyonce wore the night she set the
   record for the most Grammys won by a singer.

   “I am so honoured to be part of that,” Roseberry muses, but also
   describes the exhibition opening, sharing a platform with the great
   Elsa Schiaparelli, as a “mind-blowing moment that will go down in
   memory”. It has been a remarkable trajectory for the man from Texas.

College campuses, students and outsiders: three’s a crowd

Often canvassing support for one political outfit or the other ahead of PU’s
student polls, outsiders at have become a bit of an eyesore for the students
at Chandigarh colleges

   As campus politics heat up in the run up to the Panjab University
   Campus Student Council (PUCSC) polls, chances of one running into an
   outsider on the college campuses across the city have also shot up.

   Often canvassing support for one political outfit or the other, they
   have become a bit of an eyesore for the students and the college
   authorities.

   Even on Tuesday, which was a holiday to mark Guru Ramdas’ birth
   anniversary, the DAV campus in Sector 10 was still lively, with members
   of various political parties dotting the entrance gate. While the
   Sector 3 police station has set up a checkpoint right opposite the
   entrance, rashly-driven jeeps with party stickers could be seen
   speeding by at regular intervals.

   Police officials said only students living in hostels were allowed
   inside the campus. On the other side of the gates, a student says he
   had gotten accustomed, but not entirely comfortable, to the sight of
   crowds, the speeding cars, the odd fights and arguments that break.

   At Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma College, Sector 32, outsiders
   have also disrupted normalcy. Chirag Batra and Nikhil Bansal, both
   enrolled at the college, say many students feel that outsiders are
   crowding the campus even as the outfits based out of their own college
   are treated unfairly.

   “College authorities misbehaved with the college’s own parties. A
   recent three-hour protest to disallow outsiders from campus saw several
   students not involved in politics participate. Student elections do not
   bring around a lot of change, and we don’t want to see brawls and
   violence on our campus,” the duo added.

   Indian National Students Organisation (INSO) leader from DAV-10,
   Aashish Phogat says authorities need to toughen up the act against
   outsiders, “While checking ID proof at the entrance is a must, in case
   there is any suspicion there is a server room right besides the gate
   where the roll number of a student can be checked to verify the
   identity.”

   Presidential candidate at the SD college representing the Sanatan
   Dharam College Union and Sanatan Dharam Hostel Union, Ritik Shukla,
   echoes the sentiment, saying, “While the college’s own party faces the
   authorities’ ire, parties which bring on members from Panjab University
   are given a free hand at roaming around the campus.”

   In the face of chaos, authorities have been forced to get extra help
   with crowd control. DAV-10 principal Pawan Sharma says, “We have hired
   four bouncers for the election period. Nobody is allowed to enter the
   campus without photo ID proof as we have had problems with outsiders
   instigating the students in the past.”

   The problems are more complex for all-girls colleges. Principal of the
   girls’ college in Sector 42, Nisha Aggarwal said, “From Wednesday,
   entry for outsiders had been strictly banned. Boys especially are not
   allowed inside the campus, and the students must carry their ID cards
   with them to enter.”

   Another city college principal, not wishing to be named, meanwhile,
   offered a quick reminder that while college authorities are trying
   their best to keep a check on outsiders, the UT administration must
   chip in with support to help keep campuses conducive for its students.

De Beers’ CEO Bruce Cleaver to make way for outsider Al Cook

The CEO of De Beers, Bruce Cleaver, will step down in 2023 to take up a
non-executive role, with outsider Al Cook named as his replacement. Cook is
currently vice-president of exploration international production for Equinor
ASA, a Norway-based energy company, and he will assume the helm at an
interesting time for the diamond industry.

   Unlike a diamond, being CEO of De Beers is not forever.

   Anglo American CEO Duncan Wanblad said in a statement that Cleaver had
   decided “to step back after six years to a non-executive role”. There
   had been speculation that Cleaver was in contention to replace former
   Anglo CEO Mark Cutifani, who retired in April.

   Cook cut his teeth at BP and then Equinor in an international energy
   career and Wanblad commented that his “… multidisciplinary strategic
   skill set and strong personal conviction and values are ideally suited
   to the nature of De Beers, a global business that spans much of the
   spectrum, from exploration and mining to Bond Street and Madison
   Avenue”.

   De Beers certainly does span a wide spectrum and these are interesting
   times for the global diamond industry. The traditional site auctions
   that De Beers perfected – in part to retain a tight grip on the trade –
   are being challenged by upstarts that are selling directly to
   manufacturers.

   Meanwhile, De Beers has set its sights on remote locations – such as
   the coast of Greenland – for exploration and is producing diamonds in
   the Canadian Arctic.

   waters | Reuters

   Under Cleaver, the company had returned to Angola after a 20-year
   absence and even began exploring again around Kimberley, where it all
   began in 1869.

   Cleaver also navigated De Beers through the choppy waters of the Covid
   pandemic.

   Producers are keenly aware of the “blood” or “conflict diamond” risk to
   their reputation and keeping stringent tabs on the sourcing of gems
   remains a priority.

   Among the tasks in Cook’s inbox will be the renewal of De Beers’
   marketing agreement for the production of rough diamonds from Botswana
   via Debswana, its joint venture with the government.

   “The Government of the Republic of Botswana and De Beers Group have
   extended their existing agreement for the sale of Debswana’s rough
   diamond production by 12 months until 30 June 2023. Following further
   positive progress towards a new agreement being made in the first half
   of 2022, the two parties have agreed to the one-year extension to
   enable the finalisation of the ongoing discussions,” De Beers said in
   June.

   So, the incoming CEO has a lot on his plate, and Anglo’s shareholders
   and other stakeholders will be expecting a polished performance. BM/DM

This political 'outsider' is running for Peoria mayor. What voters should
know about Jason Beck
     __________________________________________________________________

   Taylor Seely   | Arizona Republic

   Jason Beck describes himself as a Christian conservative, but long
   before entering the Peoria mayoral race, he characterized himself as a
   calloused kid who liked to fight.

   He grew up in Missouri with a mom he said was abusive, an absent father
   and in and out of foster care — a combination that “hardened” him, he
   said on the Arizona Originals podcast.

   Beck tried college, but said it wasn't for him. He told The Arizona
   Republic he wasn’t a good student and he wanted to earn money, not
   accrue debt.

   "I knew that that was my way out of poverty," he said.

   He joined the Marine Corps Reserve in 1992, but didn't see it as a
   career path. After three years, Beck said he took an option to cut his
   contract short.

   Instead, he found a career in fighting, returning to the mixed-martial
   arts he'd practiced as a kid. Teaching Jiu Jitsu led him to Arizona,
   where he eventually trained military and law enforcement personnel in
   MMA.

   By 2001, he launched a company selling tactical gear, then sold it
   seven years later, he said. He would open a similar business in Peoria
   in 2010.

   Beck's Tyr Tactical quietly grew into one of Peoria's largest private
   employers with more than 300 workers in a shop near Loop 101 and Olive
   Avenue. The company makes products such as bulletproof vests and
   shields for police departments across the country and military
   forces around the globe.

   Peoria, like many cities, seeks high-wage employers, and Beck campaigns
   on his experience growing a business. At his company, he offers a full
   slate of health benefits and a free onsite medical clinic, but some of
   his employees qualify for state-funded health insurance. There are
   mixed reviews of the work culture.

   Beck and his company gained the political spotlight when then-Vice
   President Mike Pence toured the facility and campaigned there for
   Donald Trump in 2020. Two years later, Beck is making his first run for
   political office with the support of Republican politicians from U.S.
   Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., to state Senate President Karen Fann.

   While he has found a strong base of support, some wonder how far right
   Beck's political ties extend.

   Beck, for his part, has said he would be a mayor for all and that such
   questions are meant to distract from the city's flawed leadership.

   He has criticized the city for its emergency response times and for not
   spending more to staff public safety.

   He said he's running to make Peoria more "business focused" and
   questions the ability of his opponent in the Nov. 8 mayoral election,
   seven-year City Council member Bridget Binsbacher, to build investor
   confidence.  He's tired of seeing the city build apartments where they
   should be building jobs, he said.

   "Peoria needs an outsider and a jobs creator to actually change the
   future of the city and to actually drive the city to its future
   development," Beck said at a recent mayoral debate.

   Beck and Binsbacher are engaged in one of the most contentious,
   expensive and partisan mayoral races in the city's history.

Beck's relationship with the far right

   Some Peoria residents have questioned his connections to some on the
   far right.

   At least one member of the Patriot Party of Arizona appeared to
   have helped Beck knock on doors to build support last February,
   according to social media posts.

   “We're going to hit the ground this Sunday 0800. Where’s my Peoria
   Patriots? Please join us at the Beck Compound to meet up and get the
   good news out to our neighbors!,” wrote Traci Kinney, an administrator
   of the Patriot Party Facebook Group.

   Kinney later told The Republic she never knocked on doors for Beck but
   that she supported him.

   The grassroots activist group, Patriot Party of Arizona, which says it
   espouses "constitutional conservatism," has grown alongside a
   larger Patriot movement defined by divisive and conspiratorial
   beliefs.

   The movement has been at the center of debates over gun rights, sex
   education in schools and re-opening the state during the pandemic. They
   also claim the 2020 election was rigged and rally around so-called
   "election integrity" reforms such as banning mail-in ballots and
   restricting voting to one day in person.

   Kinney contends Patriot Party members are not far right or
   extremist but rather true conservatives who haven't shifted left like
   many establishment Republicans. She added that she did not like Beck's
   affiliation with some Republicans she calls "RINOS," or Republican in
   name only.

   Beck said he has never been a member of the Patriot Party and only
   first heard of them  last year.

   GOP

   “Jason Beck is Peoria’s only choice for constitutional conservatives,”
   Kinney wrote in another Facebook post in March. She added an eyeball
   emoji, saying “(Look or watch) CLOSELY! We’re just getting started!”

   Kinney has driven around town in one of the trucks with a massive
   digital billboard supporting Beck. Beck has not claimed use of the
   trucks on his campaign finance reports, which prompted a resident to
   file a complaint against him that is under investigation.

   Beck has also hosted events at his company alongside candidates and
   others who claim the 2020 election was rigged, including Abe Hamadeh, a
   vocal election denier running for Arizona attorney general, and Richard
   Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence under
   President Trump.

   Beck donated $5,000 to Hamadeh's campaign, according to state records.

   State Rep. Shawnna Bolick, R-Phoenix, endorsed Beck. Bolick, in the
   uproar over Biden's win in the 2020 presidential election, sponsored
   legislation that would have allowed state lawmakers to choose the slate
   of presidential electors instead of voters if they believed there was
   fraud.

   results

   David Sandoval, a Peoria school board member who is running as a
   Democrat for the state Legislature, rescinded his endorsement of Beck
   this spring, saying most of his endorsements catered to a “certain
   sector” of Peoria.

   Sandoval's family was born and raised in the Old Town area and
   he'd heard grievances from south Peoria residents who felt
   underrepresented by the City Council. He initially endorsed Beck after
   listening to the story of how he grew up, seeing his company's success
   and hearing his message that he’d be a mayor for all. But after seeing
   Beck’s other endorsements, he pulled out.

   "What he and I spoke about and what he told me, doesn't seem to be in
   line with what his campaign looks like and what his messaging is,"
   Sandoval said.

   Peoria City Councilmember Denette Dunn, a registered independent, told
   The Republic she encouraged Beck to run for mayor after a conversation
   with Kinney and a talk with Beck quelled her concerns.

   “My big thing is I don’t like extremism, but that’s me. I still have to
   serve people that have extreme beliefs," Dunn told The Republic. "We
   should all try to get along and understand each other.”

   Dunn also said she considered the Trump campaign signs that were
   plastered on Tyr Tactical's building in 2020. The city received two
   complaints against Beck at the time for displaying a Trump 2020 flag
   and three Trump-Pence campaign posters on the outside of the building.
   The city cited Beck for not obtaining a temporary signage permit for
   the posters but not for the flag, which it said was simply a show of
   support that did not violate city code. Beck removed the posters,
   Peoria records show.

   “Like a million other people, I saw the big Trump signs on the
   building,” Dunn said. “I wanted to make sure if he was interested (in
   running), would he serve everybody? ...  I asked him a lot of tough
   questions, and I was really happy with the answers that he gave me.”

   At a recent mayoral debate, the candidates were asked if the 2020
   election was free and fair. Both skirted the question. Binsbacher
   said it was time to move on. Beck offered a refrain similar to what has
   been asserted by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters and
   Republican Secretary of State candidate Mark Finchem.

   "Our president is Joe Biden, and the reason we know that is because
   we've got the worst economy since 1929," Beck said.

   He went on to add, "What we need to do is actually make sure that we
   have a focus on our city."

   safety

Campaigning among Republicans

   City elections are nonpartisan, meaning a candidate's political party
   affiliation isn't on the ballot.

   But Beck, who is a registered Republican like Binsbacher, has the
   support of many GOP politicians and organizers in Peoria.

   In addition to Lesko and Fann, he also has the endorsement of House
   Majority Leader Ben Toma, R-Peoria, who lost his City Council seat to
   Binsbacher in 2015.

   Lori Bango, who formed the AZ Christian Patriots group and chairs
   Legislative District 28 Republicans, is an active Beck supporter.

   In turn, Beck has also supported GOP candidates, including:
     * $5,300 to Matt Salmon, a Republican who ran for governor.
     * $5,000 to Hamadeh.
     * $2,000 to Bolick, who lost her bid to become secretary of state.
     * $2,500 to Andrew Gould, an unsuccessful candidate for attorney
       general.
     * $2,500 to Beverly Pingerelli, a Republican seeking reelection to
       the state Legislature.
     * $1,500 to Devon Day for Peoria school board.
     * $1,500 to Heather Rooks for Peoria school board.

   Beck has continued to open Tyr Tactical's facilities for Republican
   gatherings, hosting a Karrin Taylor Robson campaign event in July in
   the same week LD28 Republicans held an event there that included Kari
   Lake. Robson lost to Lake in the GOP primary for governor a couple of
   weeks later.

Beyond the politics

   Beyond politics, to Beck’s friends, he is a successful businessman,
   faithful family man and obvious choice for mayor. He is married with
   six sons.

   Mark Moore, a pastor at Christ's Church of the Valley in Peoria, said
   he met Beck a dozen or so years ago when Beck approached him looking
   for guidance on “truly living as a disciple of Jesus.”

   The conversation became an entry point to a years-long friendship.
   They've gone on pilgrimages to Israel and hunting trips — Beck’s love
   of hunting is on display at his office, where two deer heads are
   mounted behind his desk. Beck also began leading a weekly church group
   in his home.

   “He is first and foremost a father and a husband,” said Moore, who
   has donated $1,000 to his campaign.

   Through the years, Moore said he’s seen the different sides of Beck and
   what drives him.

   “You’re going to experience two Jason Becks. One is a very forward
   looking, I don’t mean aggressive in a negative way, but a very —” Moore
   regathered his thoughts. “Let me say it this way. He’s a very driven
   businessman.”

   He explained that Beck is a “straight shooter” who “wants to be the
   best at what he does.”

   He also described Beck as a protector. “He's in the body armor
   industry. He does that so that he can protect people,” Moore said.

   Lesko called Beck “passionate,” “energetic” and “genuinely nice.”

   “You can’t help but be inspired by him,” she told The Republic. “He has
   a vision and he knows how to get something done.”

   Lesko, who lives in Peoria, said the city needs his business savvy.

   Beck also has support from the Mexican-American advocacy group Chicanos
   por la Causa and Peoria AFSCME labor union, which represents city
   workers. He's garnered the accolades of longtime Peoria resident Eva
   Osuna, too.

   Osuna, a Democrat who drives around with a Biden-Harris bumper sticker,
   said she protested at Tyr Tactical when Beck hosted Pence in 2020. She
   doesn’t align with him ideologically, but this is a nonpartisan race,
   she said, and she’s drawn to his accessibility.

   “He’s so open to dialogue. I like that,” Osuna said, though she noted
   she still hadn't decided if she'd vote for him.

In the workplace

   Beck repeatedly picked up tiny scraps of trash on the warehouse floor
   as he toured a Republic reporter around Tyr Tactical.

   He pointed out meticulous details: the white power cords hanging from
   the white ceiling over work stations. This was non-negotiable, he said.
   He wanted the facility to feel light and airy, not like a jail or a
   dungeon.

   The bathrooms have a number and light above each door. Fifteen
   bathrooms for 15 teams. A light shining red or green above the door
   indicates when the restroom is in use.

   It’s for efficiency and courtesy, he said. So people don’t stop working
   and waste time walking over to an in-use bathroom.

   The workers on the warehouse floor, mostly at sewing machines, were
   diverse.

   About 45% of the 320 employees are Hispanic, 28% are Asian, 22% are
   white and 5% are Black, according to data the company provided The
   Republic. The company did not provide statistics for diversity among
   upper management.

   Beck said he deploys a “leaders-eat-last mentality” and he credited his
   employees as "the backbone of our company" after receiving a recent
   Arizona Manufacturer of the Year Award from the Arizona Chamber of
   Commerce and Industry and the Arizona Manufacturers Council.

   Beck told The Republic he believes if he takes care of his employees,
   they’ll take care of him.

   He points to Tyr Tactical’s medical clinic as an example. Beck said he
   employs a doctor who workers can see for free. He also offers health
   care coverage, although he said some of his employees prefer
   state-funded health insurance.

   “They like the process of AHCCCS because they don’t have to pay
   anything at all,” Beck said. “I think employees will game the system as
   much as they can whenever it comes to those things.”

   AHCCCS, or Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, is provided by
   the state to people with disabilities, pregnant women and low-income
   individuals who live within a certain range of the federal poverty
   level.

   The federal poverty level for a family of four for 2022 is $27,750.

   Beck said the average warehouse employee at Tyr Tactical makes $14.90
   an hour, with a longer term goal to increase it to $16.50.

   “We've had the state increases in minimum wage, you know, in a very
   rapid fashion, which has not been real business friendly, to be honest
   with you,” he added.

   Jobs website Indeed.com, which allows people to anonymously rank and
   review companies, shows positive reviews that highlight the health,
   dental and eye insurance as well as opportunities for overtime
   and annual pay increases.

   Overall, Tyr Tactical averaged three out of five stars.

   More critical reviews said the owner would tear into workers without
   knowing all the details of a situation and play favorites. Another
   review called Beck a visionary, but said his drive can create a toxic
   environment where people can be afraid to speak up.

   Michael Koncar, who worked at Tyr Tactical until 2019, said he was one
   of those favorites. But he ran into trouble when he decided to join the
   military. He delayed telling the company, he said, because he feared
   being fired.

   After he notified HR, Koncar said Beck pulled him into a meeting with
   other company leaders and screamed at him for what he guessed was five
   minutes, spewing profanities and calling him an emasculating
   expletive for not signing up for active duty military.

   Koncar said he returned to work the next week and was pulled into
   another meeting with Beck. In an audio recording of the meeting
   provided to The Republic, Beck can be heard explaining why he got
   angry.

   It wasn’t about Koncar joining the military, Beck explained in the
   recording, it was that he delayed telling the company. The way Beck saw
   it, Koncar had a future at the company, he said.

   Beck acknowledged the dispute to The Republic, but denied using the
   emasculating expletive and characterized Koncar as a disgruntled
   employee. Beck said any major issues he's had with employees were
   because they lied, stole or cheated.

   "Not everybody's always ethical, and I have a serious problem with
   that," he said.

   Koncar was fired a few months later. Beck said Koncar stole company
   property and illegally sold it online. Koncar said Beck allowed him and
   other employees to take leftover gear from Beck's former company.

   “It wasn’t stealing anything. It was like, ‘Hey, throw this away or
   take what you want.’ It was very clear that that was the intention,”
   Koncar told The Republic.

   In the podcast from 2019, Beck had said when he was young that he
   wanted stability and safety. But he didn’t understand what he was going
   through mentally.

   “It was more about, ‘Hey, you need to suck it up, be a hard ass in
   life.’ And I did. So that’s the way I handled things,” Beck said on the
   podcast. “It made me a very hard person to deal with. While I was there
   for my friends, I was a very loving person in some ways, I was a hard
   ass. And that probably still has a lot of stick to it still during
   these days.”

The Outsider: Consider yourself local? Have your say and vote

   "Some recreation-focused residents of Whistler sometimes forget

   whistleroutsidervote Time in the mountains can make you think... about
   who to vote for in the municipal election this Saturday, Oct. 15.Photo
   by Vince Shuley
   Listen to this article
   00:05:27

   Like many international transplants, for the first 10 years of living
   in Whistler, I couldn’t vote in any of Canada’s elections. Not that it
   particularly bothered me, because I was all about having a good time:
   ski, bike, beer, repeat. Politics didn’t concern me, and I was
   blissfully ignorant of community concerns, provincial policies and
   federal funding.

   It took me about 10 years to gain my Certificate of Canadian
   Citizenship, which I still proudly display on my home office wall.
   Fellow seasonals-turned-lifers know all too well the length and
   bureaucratic hassle of that process; qualifying for one of Canada’s
   immigration programs, collecting written proof of jobs worked a decade
   ago, procuring criminal record checks from any country in which you
   spent more than a few months... I could fill this entire page with
   document checklists and proverbial hoops one needs to jump through in
   order to gain Permanent Residency (PR) status in Canada. And I think I
   can speak for every Permanent Resident when I say the effort is worth
   it. No more stress about work visas or whether you’ll need to exit the
   country at the end of the season. The PR milestone signifies the moment
   when you can genuinely lay your foundations in this country, this
   province and this community.

   But there’s one catch. PR doesn’t allow you to vote. For that
   constitutional right, you must get a passing score of 16/20 on your
   citizenship test and swear your allegiance to Canada and its (new)
   king. You don’t need to go to England or anything, you just need to
   stand in a room full of people in front of a judge, pledge your
   allegiance to this country and sing O Canada. This ceremony is a far
   less emotive affair in today’s Zoom version, but is still an
   unforgettable day in the lives of newly-naturalized Canadians.

   The biggest practical benefit of naturalization is being able to apply
   for a Canadian passport, so you no longer need to hold up your Canadian
   friends at the border on that road trip to the States. The biggest
   civic benefit of calling oneself Canadian? You guessed it.

   Voting in federal, provincial and (arguably most importantly) municipal
   elections.

   I’m not going to go into which council candidates support what and all
   the hot- button issues like housing, sustainability etc. since we’ve
   had plenty of that commentary already. What I will say is that some
   recreation-focused residents of Whistler sometimes forget that—for
   better or worse—political change affects us all. And yes, that applies
   at the local level.

   Let’s take a look at a few of the reasons Whistler residents may not
   vote, or more likely, just not bother.

I can’t vote because I’m not Canadian yet. I would if they allowed
non-Canadians to vote.

   Fair enough. I get the frustration of not being able to have your say
   when you’ve lived in Whistler for years, contributed to its economy and
   genuinely care about your community. But voting is a constitutional
   right reserved for those who have citizenship at birth or immigrants
   who run through the aforementioned process. Start yours now and you may
   get to vote in 2026.

There are so many candidates I can’t keep track. A lot of them are saying the
same thing: “we need more housing, yadda yadda.” How am I supposed to make an
informed vote?

   Yes, there are a lot of candidates. Some of them you may even know
   personally or professionally. The best resource is the paper in your
   hands. Pique’s reporters do a bang-up job of council and mayoral
   candidate profiles. G.D. Maxwell takes it a step further with his own
   endorsements. If you want to get a sense of everyone’s platform while
   say, washing the dishes, replay the Pique all-candidates meeting on
   your phone. It is three hours long, but you can skip around to the
   juicy parts.

Have you seen the weather this October? Screw the election, I’m going camping
this weekend.

   The strange and very welcomed sunny weather this October may well be
   the biggest contributor to a poor voter turnout on election day. But
   the future of your community shouldn’t take a backseat to one more
   great weekend of the seemingly endless summer of 2023. Advanced polling
   has been and gone, but General Voting Day kicks off at 8 a.m. on Oct.
   15 at Myrtle Philip Community School. So have your car packed the night
   before, wake up early and go vote. Put that on your Instagram stories
   before all your other weekend highlights.

   We have some solid incumbents running for re-election. Cathy Jewett and
   Jen Ford are the two I trust most to balance progress with the steady
   hand of experience. It’s great to see a bunch of younger candidates in
   the running, too, though not all seem to have done their homework. The
   one candidate I’ve seen present themselves with research and knowledge
   akin to more experienced councillors is Brendan Ladner, a.k.a. the
   “Skiable Future” guy. Yeah, the slogan is kinda tacky, but Ladner
   struck me as having a work ethic that matches his passion.

   As Pique editor Braden Dupuis wrote recently, “If you’re not actively
   involved, you get the policy you deserve. Simple as that.” That goes
   for all you skiers, bikers, hikers, skaters, softball leaguers,
   volleyball players and anyone else who prioritizes fun recreation over
   most other things in life. Real locals give a shit. So have your say on
   Saturday.

   Vince Shuley wants you to vote this Saturday, October 15. For

“What I found was really great enthusiasm for him”—Nigeria’s outsider

   OUR CORRESPONDENT meets with Peter Obi, who has a handsome poll lead
   and an appeal that spans the country’s religions and ethnicities. But
   his presidential bid still faces obstacles. Myanmar’s ruling junta is
   doing more than suppressing the country’s people: it is battering the
   economy equally efficiently. And remembering Brother Andrew, who made
   daring deliveries behind the Iron Curtain. Runtime: 25 min

Vampires Are Taking Over Pop Culture Again—But This Time, the Monster Is Us

   A decade after Twilight mania, bloodsuckers are back in the pop-culture
   spotlight—and more human than ever (Robert Hickerson for TIME)
   A decade after Twilight mania, bloodsuckers are back in the pop-culture
   spotlight—and more human than ever
   Robert Hickerson for TIME
   By Judy Berman
   October 11, 2022 10:56 AM EDT

   Reginald Andres is not like other vampires. Sure, he has a pair of
   retractable fangs, subsists on blood, and sizzles in the sun. Yet the
   hero of Syfy horror comedy Reginald the Vampire, played by Jacob
   Batalon, is also timid and geeky and self-conscious about his round
   belly. It doesn’t help that the vampire community is more superficial
   than a nest of high school mean girls.

   Listen, not every bloodsucker is a supermodel—just ask cinema’s
   ur-vampire Nosferatu. But if the past century of film and TV are any
   indication, then they’ve yet to receive the body-positivity memo.
   Adapted from Johnny B. Truant’s comic Fat Vampire, the silly but sweet
   Reginald plays with the trope of the svelte, impossibly attractive
   vampire. Instead of sinking his teeth into swooning humans, Reginald
   nurses a crush on a co-worker. Instead of lying around some mansion
   decorated in velvet and brocade, he slings slushies at a fast-food
   joint.

   Roughly a decade after the last, Twilight-driven wave of vampire media
   subsided, Dracula’s children are once again becoming pop culture’s
   monster of choice. And this time, they’re more than just objects of
   inchoate lust. While the fang-enhanced characters that populate new
   movies like Morbius, books like Claire Kohda’s Woman, Eating, and a
   particular glut of TV shows, from What We Do in the Shadows to Anne
   Rice’s Interview with the Vampire, are not all nebbishes like Reginald,
   they do seem more human than ever. Neither dastardly nor debonair,
   these undead creatures hang out with roommates, squabble with parents,
   suffer from chronic illnesses, and even experience discrimination based
   on differences they can’t control. Vampires—they’re just like us!
   (Except, of course, that we’re still their prey.)
   Jacob Batalon in <lt;i>gt;Reginald the Vampire<lt;/i>gt; (James Dittiger—Syfy)
   Jacob Batalon in Reginald the Vampire
   James Dittiger—Syfy

   Vampires have always stood in for outsiders deemed exotic and
   dangerous, hiding in plain sight. Emerging into a fearful, fragmented
   society, however, at a time when binaries like insider-outsider,
   oppressor-oppressed, and us-them have never felt more subjective, these
   new vampire narratives blur the line separating mortal souls from
   allegedly soulless immortals. Not only is monstrousness in the eye of
   the beholder, but those of us who have reflections might be just as
   likely to find it in the mirror as we are to catch it tapping on our
   window.

   It’s no coincidence that the quintessential vampire story, Bram
   Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula, begins with an Englishman’s journey east
   to Transylvania in order to help a local nobleman, one Count Dracula,
   relocate to the UK. Embedded in their dynamic is the terror of
   concealed difference that is the psychological hallmark of vampire
   lore—in this case, the idea that a wealthy, influential foreigner might
   look like “one of us” but mean “us” harm.

   The fact that vampire lore dates back to antiquity, when it surfaced in
   several discrete, Eastern and Western cultures—and, as recently a few
   centuries ago, fueled outbreaks of mass hysteria on both sides of the
   Atlantic—underscores how entrenched most civilizations’ fear of the
   other has always been. In the 20th century West, where “one of us”
   meant white, straight, and Christian, vampires could stand in for

   any other supposed outsider who could conceivably blend into a crowd.

   As countercultures exploded and progressive movements brought
   marginalized voices to the forefront, the allegories shifted. In the
   1960s and ’70s, vampires often represented the simultaneous thrills and
   perils of free love. Around the turn of the millennium, our
   culture-wide infatuation with the unknown yielded a flood of
   human-vampire romance franchises: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Twilight,
   The Vampire Diaries, The Southern Vampire Mysteries book series and its
   HBO adaptation, True Blood. Before it devolved into a mess of heaving
   bosoms and mixed metaphors, True Blood drew parallels between vampires
   “mainstreaming,” or living openly alongside humans, thanks to the
   invention of synthetic blood, and queer people integrating into
   straight society—complete with radicals who’d rather get staked than
   conform.

   Yet even as mortal heroines embraced their bloodsucker paramours,
   storytellers held them at arm’s length. The protagonists they created
   were almost always human, and brooding vamps like Twilight’s Edward
   Cullen and Buffy’s Angel maintained an unknowable mystique.

   The new generation of vampires is anything but cryptic. Just as
   Reginald vents anxieties to his maker (Mandela Van Peebles), the Staten
   Island roommates in FX’s hilarious Shadows—a vanguard of the vampire
   comeback, after four seasons—eagerly unload petty grievances on a
   documentary crew. Netflix’s First Kill, which debuted in June and was
   quickly canceled, to the outrage of fans, is narrated in part by
   teenage Juliette (Sarah Catherine Hook), whose immortal family won’t
   stop pressuring her to complete a daunting rite of passage:
   slaughtering her first victim. This unique problem activates universal
   adolescent angst. “Even on good days, I still feel like I don’t fit
   in,” Juliette laments. “Like everyone has it all figured out—the
   clothes they wear, the bands they like, who they are, who they wanna
   be. And I’m the only one stuck pretending.”

   These days, the typical coming-of-age vampire story is less a human’s
   fantasy of first love than it is a monster’s own bildungsroman.
   Peacock’s teen drama Vampire Academy, an adaptation of the Twilight-era
   YA books by Richelle Mead, takes place at a prep school for vampires,
   where students chafe against class divisions and struggle to live up to
   family legacies. Showtime’s disappointing Let the Right One In,
   premiering Oct. 7, twists the Swedish novel turned big-screen horror
   masterpiece into a gritty, New York crime drama. Among the only
   elements the show shares with the movie is a friendship between a
   vampire trapped in an eternally preadolescent body, Eleanor (Madison
   Taylor Baez), and her next-door neighbor, Isaiah (Ian Foreman), a
   gentle, bullied middle schooler. Eleanor’s predicament echoes that of
   Claudia in the new AMC drama Anne Rice’s Interview With the Vampire.
   Made immortal at 14, Claudia matures mentally but not physically—which
   sets her up for a long lifetime of choosing between loneliness and
   partners perversely attracted to her unnaturally childish appearance.

   Framed as a more honest follow-up to vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac’s
   (Jacob Anderson) confession to a naive young reporter in Rice’s novel
   and the 1994 film, this Interview casts Eric Bogosian as the same
   journalist half a century later. Rather than reverting to innuendo, the
   show makes plain—and explicit—the sexual relationship between Louis and
   his male maker, Lestat (Sam Reid). Because Louis is also Black, in
   1910s New Orleans, becoming immortal makes him a triply misunderstood
   outsider. He’s not the only queer vampire pouring their heart out, so
   to speak, to a human audience this year. When First Kill’s Juliette
   develops a crush on a classmate (Imani Lewis) she doesn’t know is a
   slayer, the attraction could turn fatal for either girl. The bookish
   first-person narrator of Isaac Fellman’s 2022 novel Dead Collections is
   Sol, a transgender man who works as an archivist. “I didn’t see myself
   as being in the closet about my illness, my vampirism,” he recalls,
   “but I’d only ever told my boss and HR.”

   Shadows<lt;/i>gt; (John P Johnson—FX)

   Sol is one of many recent characters, from Right One’s Eleanor to
   Morbius’ eponymous Marvel antihero, whose thirst for blood is tied to a
   humanizing medical condition rather than an evil nature. More unusual
   is Sol’s resemblance to Fellman, who is also a trans man and an
   archivist; to at least some extent, Collections is a work of vampire
   autofiction. It makes sense that LGBTQ creators are reclaiming an
   archetype—monster—that has so often been deployed against them as a
   slur. As author Carmen Maria Machado notes in Shudder docuseries Queer
   for Fear, “If you’ve been on the other side of the pitchfork, you’re
   maybe a little sympathetic to the monster.”

   It also makes sense that outsider perspectives are supplanting those of
   the in-group, even within a niche as fantastical as vampire fiction, in
   a country where racial minorities will soon be the majority and the
   number of Americans who identify as queer or trans is steadily rising.
   The arts have trended towards diversity—or at least towards an expanded
   understanding that diverse representation might be desirable—since
   Buffy, which was celebrated in its time as a paragon of pop feminism,
   hired an all-white cast of vamps and slayers. Meanwhile, subversive
   movies like Raw and particularly Get Out have ushered in an age of
   socially progressive horror.

   But there’s more to the relatable-vampire phenomenon than a convergence
   of demographic and industry trends. On an emotional level, it resonates
   within a culture that turns disagreement into demonization. In the
   post-Trump era, the sweetest-looking Middle American mom might be an
   insurrectionist. Whether it’s a neighbor, a cab driver, or that cousin
   you had to unfriend on Facebook, any normal-seeming acquaintance is
   liable to start spewing venom that burns you to your core. It’s a bit
   like watching fangs suddenly descend from a friendly smile.

   Of course, to the insurrectionists, the rest of us (or our nonexistent
   globalist puppet masters, I guess), even those who don’t fit into any
   traditional outsider category, are the monsters. Polarized reactions to
   the pandemic have furthered the horror metaphor; what’s scarier than an
   unmasked, unvaccinated visitor coughing SARS-CoV-2 all over a nursing
   home? As critic Jason Zinoman pointed out last year, before they became
   rakish lovers, vampires appeared in medieval folklore as “symbols of
   epidemics.” More terrifying, at least psychologically, is the way COVID
   forced every compassionate person to question whether we, too, might be
   asymptomatic monsters flying under the radar. We could take every
   precaution and still get infected—or even unwittingly pass the virus to
   someone who’d eventually die of it.

   Such mistrust of one’s own instincts and intentions is a hallmark of
   the new, introspective vampire. The narrator of Woman, Eating, Lydia,
   is a 23-year-old, Asian and white vampire who is living on her own for
   the first time and literally struggling to put food on her table. She
   doesn’t feed on humans because, as she puts it, “I want to be a good
   person”; before she moved out, her mother sourced contraband pigs’
   blood from a butcher. Mistreated at an internship where she could
   conceivably devour her supervisors and vanish into the night, Lydia
   sees herself not as a coherent being but as a body where human and
   demon uneasily cohabit.

   Bloodthirst aside, this is a pretty effective encapsulation of what it
   means to be a person with free will. Unless we behave so atrociously as
   to destroy any chance of redemption, each of us is the site of a war
   between good and evil that will rage on for as long as we live—and that
   might remain unresolved by any legacy we leave. I mean, how bloody
   relatable is that?

Outsider art

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to navigation Jump to search
   Art created outside the boundaries of official culture by those
   untrained in the arts
   "Art brut" redirects here. For the band, see Art Brut (band).
   Adolf Wölfli's Irren-Anstalt Band-Hain, 1910
   Anna Zemánková, No title, 1960s

   Outsider art is art made by self-taught or supposedly naïve artists
   with typically little or no contact with the conventions of the art
   worlds. In many cases, their work is discovered only after their
   deaths. Often, outsider art illustrates extreme mental states,
   unconventional ideas, or elaborate fantasy worlds.

   The term outsider art was coined in 1972 as the title of a book by art
   critic Roger Cardinal.^[1] It is an English equivalent for art brut
   (French: [aʁ bʁyt], "raw art" or "rough art"), a label created in the
   1940s by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside
   the boundaries of official culture. Dubuffet focused particularly on
   art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as
   examples psychiatric hospital patients, hermits, and
   spiritualists.^[2]^[3]

   Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an
   annual Outsider Art Fair^[4] has taken place in New York since 1993,
   and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to
   the subject. The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing
   label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream "art
   world" or "art gallery system", regardless of their circumstances or
   the content of their work.^[5] A more specific term, "outsider music",
   was later adapted for musicians.

Art of the mentally ill[edit]

   See also: Creativity and mental illness

   Interest in the art of the mentally ill, along with that of children
   and the makers of "peasant art", was first demonstrated by "Der Blaue
   Reiter" group: Wassily Kandinsky, August Macke, Franz Marc, Alexej von
   Jawlensky, and others. What the artists perceived in the work of these
   groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of
   sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first
   and only issue of their publication, Der Blaue Reiter Almanac. During
   World War I, Macke was killed at Champagne in 1914 and Marc was killed
   at Verdun in 1916; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent
   filled by Paul Klee, who continued to draw inspiration from these
   'primitives'.

   Interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the
   1920s. In 1921, Dr. Walter Morgenthaler published his book Ein
   Geisteskranker als Künstler (A Psychiatric Patient as Artist) about
   Adolf Wölfli, a psychotic mental patient in his care. Wölfli had
   spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him.
   His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in
   which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages,
   1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work.
   Wölfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which
   were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the Adolf Wölfli
   Foundation in the Museum of Fine Art, Bern.

   A defining moment was the publication of Bildnerei der Geisteskranken
   (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) in 1922, by Hans Prinzhorn. This was the
   first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of
   thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art
   collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time,
   including Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Jean Dubuffet.^[6]

   People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established
   artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be
   institutionalized. For example, William Kurelek, later awarded the
   Order of Canada for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted
   to the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated for
   schizophrenia.^[7] In the hospital he painted, producing The Maze, a
   dark depiction of his tortured youth.^[8] He was transferred from the
   Maudsley to Netherne Hospital from November 1953 to January 1955, to
   work with Edward Adamson (1911–1996), a pioneer of art therapy, and
   creator of the Adamson Collection.

Jean Dubuffet and art brut[edit]

   View inside the Collection de l'art brut museum, Lausanne

   French artist Jean Dubuffet was particularly struck by Bildnerei der
   Geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art, which he
   called art brut or raw art. In 1948 he formed the Compagnie de l'Art
   Brut along with other artists, including André Breton and Claude
   Lévi-Strauss.^[9] The collection he established became known as the
   Collection de l'art brut and the curator was Slavko Kopač for almost
   three decades.^[10] It contains thousands of works and is now
   permanently housed in Lausanne, Switzerland.

   Dubuffet characterized art brut as:

     Those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic
     creative impulses – where the worries of competition, acclaim and
     social promotion do not interfere – are, because of these very
     facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a
     certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted
     feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we
     cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural
     art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a
     fallacious parade.

          — Jean Dubuffet, "Place à l'incivisme" (December 1987 – February
          1988).^[11] Dubuffet's writing on art brut was the subject of a
          noted program at the Art Club of Chicago in the early 1950s.

   Dubuffet argued that 'culture', that is mainstream culture, managed to
   assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away
   whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine
   expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut
   was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and
   assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to
   be assimilated.

   Dubuffet’s championing of Art Brut would not last long. Scholars argue
   Dubuffet’s distaste for the mainstream art world helped ensure that art
   brut and the Compagnie de l'Art Brut would not survive on a commercial
   basis. Dubuffet would kill art brut as he defined it in his quest for
   its authenticity.^[9] Three years after the Compagnie de l'Art Brut was
   formed, Dubuffet dissolved it, caving to form the more conventional
   Collection de l'art brut afterward.^[9]

Cultural context[edit]

   The interest in "outsider" practices among twentieth-century artists
   and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection
   of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part
   of the 20th century gave rise to Cubism and the Dada, Constructivist
   and Futurist movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic
   movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist Marcel Duchamp,
   for example, abandoned "painterly" technique to allow chance operations
   a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to
   recontextualize existing "ready-made" objects as art. Mid-century
   artists, including Pablo Picasso, looked outside the traditions of high
   culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of "primitive"
   societies, the unschooled art made by children, and vulgar advertising
   graphics. Dubuffet's championing of the art brut – of the insane and
   others at the margins of society – is yet another example of
   avant-garde art challenging established cultural values. As with
   analysis of these other art movements, current discourse indicates art
   brut is innately tied to primitivism^[9]^[12] due to its similarity in
   its borrowing of personal "de-patriation" and exoticization of familiar
   yet alien forms.

Terminology[edit]

   Two images of Joe Minter's African Village in America, a half-acre
   visionary art environment in Birmingham, Alabama. Scenes include
   African warriors watching their descendants’ struggles in Alabama,
   tributes to black scientists and military leaders, recreations of the
   epic civil rights confrontations in Alabama, and biblical scenes.

   A number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood
   as "outside" of official culture. Definitions of these terms vary and
   overlap.^[13] The editors of Raw Vision, a leading journal in the
   field, suggest that "Whatever views we have about the value of
   controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by
   way of an agreed vocabulary". Consequently, they lament the use of
   "outsider artist" to refer to almost any untrained artist. "It is not
   enough to be untrained, clumsy or naïve. Outsider Art is virtually
   synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of
   art produced by those who do not know its name."
     * Art Brut: Coined by Jean Dubuffet, the term translated literally
       from French means "raw art".^[2]^[3] 'Raw' is analogous in that it
       has not been through the academic 'cooking' process: i.e. the world
       of art schools, galleries, and museums. Dubuffet’s original
       definition pertains strictly to the ‘raw art’ created by the
       autodidactic and shunned fringes of society.^[9]
     * Folk art: Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative
       skills associated with peasant communities in Europe – though
       presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has
       broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and
       decorative skill – everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap
       buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that
       folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values,
       where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to
       society's mainstream.
     * Intuitive art/Visionary art: Raw Vision Magazine's preferred
       general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate
       umbrella terms. However, visionary art, unlike other definitions
       here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which
       includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art
       is probably the most general term available. Intuit: The Center for
       Intuitive and Outsider Art based in Chicago operates a museum
       dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider
       art. The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is
       dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art.
     * Marginal art/Art singulier: Essentially the same as Neuve
       Invention; refers to artists on the margins of the art world.
     * Naïve art: Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who
       aspire to "normal" artistic status, i.e. they have a much more
       conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do
       outsider artists.
     * Neuve invention: Used to describe artists who, although marginal,
       have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing
       art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet
       too; strictly speaking, it refers only to a special part of the
       Collection de l'art brut.
     * Visionary environments: Buildings and sculpture parks built by
       visionary artists – ranging from decorated houses to large areas
       incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a
       tightly associated theme. Examples include Watts Towers by Simon
       Rodia, Buddha Park and Sala Keoku by Bunleua Sulilat, and The
       Palais Ideal by Ferdinand Cheval.

What is Outsider Art?

FREE Digital Issue:

   Raw Vision's
   100th Edition Magazine
   [RV100_480x480.png?v=1659553081]


   The controversy surrounding the exact definition of Outsider Art and
   allied fields has been going on ever since awareness of the phenomenon
   began so here we try to clarify the different aspects.

   The development of the awareness of forms of creative expression that
   exist outside accepted cultural norms, or the realm of “fine art”,
   began with the researches of psychiatrists early in the century.

   The work of Dr Morganthaler documented his patient Adolf Wolfli, a
   genius who produced countless thousands of works from a small cell in
   his Swiss asylum. Dr Hans Prinzhorn collected thousands of works by
   psychiatric patients and his book “Bildernerei der Geisteskranken”
   (Artistry of the Mentally Ill), published in 1922 became an influential
   work amongst Surrealist and other artists of the time.

   One artist who was particularly affected by the works Prinzhorn
   presented was Jean Dubuffet. Together with others, including Andre
   Breton, he formed the Compagnie de l’Art Brut in 1948 and strove to
   seek out and collect works of extreme individuality and inventiveness
   by creators who were not only untrained artists but often had little
   concept of an art gallery or even any other forms of art other than
   their own.

   Dubuffet’s concept of Art Brut was of works that were in their “raw”
   state, uncooked by cultural and artistic influences. He built up a vast
   collection of thousands of works, works which bore no relation to
   developments in contemporary art and yet were the innovative and
   powerful expressions of a wide range individuals from a variety of
   backgrounds.
     __________________________________________________________________

ART BRUT


   Artworks by Johann Hauser and Aloise Corbaz

   Art Brut was Jean Dubuffet's original term for the works that he
   collected and revered; later adopted by the Collection de l'Art Brut at
   Lausanne. Art Brut means "raw art". Raw because it is "uncooked" or
   "unadulterated" by culture. Raw because it is creation in its most
   direct and uninhibited form. Not only were the works unique and
   original but their creators were seen to exist outside established
   culture and society. The purest of Art Brut creators would not consider
   themselves artists, nor would they even feel that they were producing
   art at all. Art Brut is visual creation at its purest – a spontaneous
   psychic flow from brain to surface. (examples: Aloïse Corbaz, Carlo
   Zinelli, Madge Gill, Johann Hauser, Adolf Wölfli)
     __________________________________________________________________

OUTSIDER ART


   Artworks by Bill Traylor and Ferdinand Cheval

   The term "Outsider Art" was introduced as the title of Roger Cardinal's
   book in 1972 and was originally intended to act as an exact English
   equivalent to Dubuffet's term, although from the outset it encompassed
   not only Art Brut but also works in the Neuve Invention category Over
   the years it has been used increasingly loosely and can often now refer
   to any artist who is untrained or with disabilities or suffering social
   exclusion, whatever the nature of their work. (examples: Adolf Wölfli,
   Johann Hauser, Chomo, Bill Traylor, Frederich Schroder-Sonnenstern,
   Ferdinand Cheval, Simon Rodia)
     __________________________________________________________________

NEUVE INVENTION


   Artworks by Gaston Chaissac and Albert Louden

   Dubuffet realised that there existed many creators whose work was of
   comparable power and inventiveness to Art Brut, but their greater
   contact with normal society and the awareness they had of their art
   works precluded their inclusion within his strict Art Brut category.
   These creators were often humble workers who created in their spare
   time, or eccentric and untrained artists trying to make a living from
   their work – some of whom had dealings with commercial galleries. As an
   acknowledgement to them he formed his "Annex Collection"; in 1982 this
   became the Neuve Invention section of the Collection de l'Art Brut. As
   definitions become more merged this term is losing its significance.
   (examples: Gaston Chaissac, Mario Chichorro, Rosemarie Koczy, Gerard
   Lattier, Albert Louden, Frederich Schroder-Sonnenstern)
     __________________________________________________________________

MARGINAL ART, ART SINGULIER


   Artworks by Danielle Jacqui and Ody Saban

   Marginal art (art singulier) is a term more used in Europe relating to
   the works of artists, usually, but not exclusively, self-taught, that
   are close to Art Brut and Outsider artists, both in appearance and
   directness of expression. These are the artists "on the margins", that
   grey area of definition that lies between Outsider Art and normal
   mainstream art, very similar to Dubuffet's Neuve Invention category.
   Art Singulier encompasses French marginal artists. (examples: Chomo,
   Danielle Jacqui, Raymond Reynaud, Ody Saban)
     __________________________________________________________________

FOLK ART / CONTEMPORARY FOLK ART


   Artworks by William Edmondson and William L. Hawkins

   Folk art is a simple and direct term that has become much used in North
   America. Originally pertaining to the indigenous crafts and decorative
   skills of peasant communities in Europe, the term was later applied to
   the simply-made practical objects of colonial days – a combination of
   charm and practical craftsmanship. In contemporary terms, Folk Art can
   cover anything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings as well as
   the work of artists that would easily fall into the realm of Outsider
   Art. (examples: Sam Doyle, William Hawkins, William Edmondson, Mose
   Tolliver)
     __________________________________________________________________

SELF-TAUGHT ART


   Artworks by Thornton Dial and Mr. Imagination

   Self-taught art is a popular term in the United States which avoids the
   stigmas that some feel are attached to the Outsider Art definition.
   Many American artists are already pushed to the outer limits of society
   as a result of prejudice and feel this term offers more dignity.
   (examples: Mr Imagination, Thornton Dial)
     __________________________________________________________________

VISIONARY ART, INTUITIVE ART


   Artworks by Joe Coleman and Norbert Kox

   Visionary art and intuitive art are fairly general terms; used together
   they can include much urban folk art of the third world, as well as
   works based on religious experiences and visions. They are avoid the
   specifics of Outsider Art or Folk Art and can also be used in
   conjunction with "Self-Taught". (examples: Norbert Kox, Joe Coleman,
   Myrtice West, William Thomas Thompson, Donald Pass).
     __________________________________________________________________

NAïVE ART


   Artworks by John Kane and Ivan Generalic

   Naïve art refers to untrained artists who depict largely realistic
   scenes, often in skilled detail, with people, animals, and other
   aspects of the observed world, sometimes combined with fantasy images.
   They often aspire to normal artistic status and may often be seen as
   quite sophisticated amateurs verging on professionalism. (examples:
   Grandma Moses, John Kane, Ivan Generalic, Douanier Rousseau).
     __________________________________________________________________

VISIONARY ENVIRONMENTS


   Artworks by Simon Rodia and Nek Chand

   Visionary environments are spaces, buildings and sculpture parks built
   by intuitive artists almost defy definition. They have become known by
   various terms, Visionary Environments and Contemporary Folk Art
   Environments being perhaps the most appropriate in current use.
   Although Outsider Art has been used to describe the environments, some
   feel the label to be insulting to these particular creators, many of
   whom are integrated members of their local communities. Another popular
   term, especially in the US, is Grassroots Art, which can also cover the
   more humble expressions and constructions of ordinary folk in both town
   and country. (examples: Simon Rodia's Watts Towers, SP Dinsmoor's
   Garden of Eden, Ferdinand Cheval's Palais Ideal, Nek Chand's Rock
   Garden)

   One of the most wide-ranging studies of prejudice undertaken in a
   decade, The Outsider combines new research methods and rich analysis to
   upend many of our assumptions about prejudice. Noting that hostility
   toward immigrants has been on the rise throughout Western Europe, Paul
   Sniderman and his team conduct the first study of prejudice in Italy
   and offer insights applicable to nearly all countries worldwide. The
   study of prejudice, they argue, has been both stimulated and limited by
   tensions among partial theories. Prejudice and group conflict are said
   to be rooted in the psychological makeup of individuals, or
   alternatively, to spring from real competition over material goods or
   social status, or yet again, to follow in the wake of a quest for
   identity. It is the distinctive effort of The Outsider to develop a
   unified theory of prejudice integrating personality, realistic
   conflict, and social identity approaches.
   Drawing on computer-assisted interviewing, this book focuses on Italy
   partly because it has experienced two different waves of immigration,
   from Northern Africa and Eastern Europe, and thus allows one to
   consider to what extent the color of immigrants’ skin imposes a special
   burden of prejudice. Italy is also an apt site for the study of
   intolerance because of long-standing prejudices that have existed
   internally, between Northern and Southern Italians. The book’s findings
   show that any point of difference — color, nationality, or language —
   marks the immigrant as an outsider. The fact of difference, not the
   particular mode of difference, is crucial. Moreover, the general
   election of 1994 provided a rare opportunity to investigate the
   political impact of prejudice when the party system was itself in the
   process of transformation. The authors uncover a potential line of
   cleavage: rather than prejudice being concentrated on the political
   right, it has a wide following among the less educated of the political
   left.
   Analyzing the contributions of personality, social-structural factors,
   and political orientation to the wave of intolerance toward immigrants,
   The Outsider offers unprecedented insights into the phenomenon of
   prejudice and its link to politics.
   Paul M. Sniderman is Professor of Political Science at Stanford
   University. A Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he
   is the author of the widely influential The Scar of Race, coauthored
   with Thomas Piazza, and Reaching Beyond Race, among other books.
   Pierangelo Peri is Titular Lecturer of Methodology and Technics of
   Social Research at the University of Trento. Rui J. P. de Figueiredo,
   Jr., is Assistant Professor of Business and Public Policy at the Haas
   School of Business and is Assistant Professor in the Department of
   Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Thomas
   Piazza is Senior Survey Statistician at the Survey Research Center at
   the University of California, Berkeley.

   "A timely, provocative analysis of the sources of political prejudice
   in contemporary Italy."—Choice

   "The timing of Sniderman and his colleagues is impeccable: Just as
   right-wing extremism, driven by xenophobia, reaches the top of the
   European agenda (and not only in Austria), they bring to fruition this
   important six-year study of prejudice toward immigrants in Italy.
   Students of both Europe and of tolerance will be especially interested
   in the argument that the Left is especially vulnerable to shocks that
   increase prejudice."—Robert D. Putnam

   "The Outsider makes a landmark contribution to our understanding of
   prejudice. Analysts of public opinion, electoral behavior, party
   competition, and ethnicity in the United States and Europe will find
   the book compelling and provocative. The authors integrate and
   reconcile rival theoretical approaches, and they present empirical
   findings of great import. They bring methodological advances pioneered
   in the study of racism in the United States to the study of prejudice
   in Europe. And their discussion of the broader implications of the
   research is magisterial. The book does more than trace the roots of
   hostility toward immigrants in Italy: it illuminates the bases of
   democratic political life. The Outsider is an extraordinarily
   satisfying work of social science."—Carol Mershon, University of
   Virginia

   "The Outsider is an extraordinary book that will be of interest to
   students of politics as well as race and ethnicity. It bears comparison
   to Robert Putnam's Making Democracy Work."—Mabel Berezin, University of
   California, Los Angeles

   General Interest
   Sociology / Race, Class, and Gender
   Sociology / Culture

   Honorable Mention for the 2022 Betty and Alfred McClung Lee Book Award,
   sponsored by the Association for Humanist Sociology.

   Many enter the academy with dreams of doing good; this is a book about
   how the institution fails them, especially if they are considered
   "outsiders."

   Tenure-track, published author, recipient of prestigious fellowships
   and awards—these credentials mark Victoria Reyes as somebody who has
   achieved the status of insider in the academy. Woman of color, family
   history of sexual violence, first generation, mother—these qualities
   place Reyes on the margins of the academy; a person who does not see
   herself reflected in its models of excellence.

   This contradiction allows Reyes to theorize the conditional citizenship
   of academic life—a liminal status occupied by a rapidly growing
   proportion of the academy, as the majority white, male, and affluent
   space simultaneously transforms and resists transformation. Reyes
   blends her own personal experiences with the tools of sociology to lay
   bare the ways in which the structures of the university and the people
   working within it continue to keep their traditionally marginalized
   members relegated to symbolic status, somewhere outside the center.

   Reyes confronts the impossibility of success in the midst of competing
   and contradictory needs—from navigating coded language, to balancing
   professional expectations with care-taking responsibilities, to
   combating the literal exclusions of outmoded and hierarchical rules.
   Her searing commentary takes on, with sensitivity and fury, the urgent
   call for academic justice.

   About the author

   Victoria Reyes is Assistant Professor in the Department of Gender &amp;
   Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside. She is the
   author of multi-award-winning book Global Borderlands (Stanford, 2019),
   which was named a 2020 CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title.

   "This courageous and visionary work boldly reclaims space for women of
   color and others who have been excluded and devalued by academia. It
   invites us to reimagine and remake the academy with practices of love,
   care, and justice."

   —Crystal Marie Fleming, author of Rise Up!

   "Blending sociological analysis, feminist of color critique, and
   memoir, Reyes offers a blueprint for transforming the academy. Academic
   Outsider is the book I never knew I needed until I read it."

   —Anthony Christian Ocampo, author of Brown and Gay in LA

   "This book will be painfully familiar to many in the academy. It
   reveals how little progress has been made in the age of
   multiculturalism and diversity. A must-read for junior and senior
   faculty alike!"

   —Mary Romero, author of The Maid's Daughter

   "This book brings a level of authenticity to academia, and sociology in
   particular, that is a breath of fresh air. It works as an important
   intervention within how we see academia and who we see as exemplar
   academics. I praise the author for their vulnerability and their
   conviction—we need to better humanize scholarship and this book does
   just that."

   —Whitney Pirtle, co-editor of Black Feminist Sociology

   "A challenging and critical collection, Academic Outsider offers a
   timely analysis that interrogates the foundation of the "academic
   citizenship" that leaves many of us questioning our value rather than
   the logics of belonging embedded in the whiteness and wealth of
   academia. By weaving together personal and professional stories and
   sociological analysis, these incisive essays will surely spark
   conversation and serve as a balm for the many outsiders navigating
   their own pathway."

   —Zakiya Luna, author of Reproductive Rights as Human Rights

   "An urgent, candid, and path-breaking book. Academic Outsider uncovers
   the hidden curricula of academic gate-keeping practices and
   demonstrates how they are upheld by racial capitalism and racialized
   gender inequities. Without falling into a romanticized view of the
   margins, Reyes exposes the raw gritty effects of such practices on
   working-class women of color in the academy. She deftly unmasks the
   material conditions that make these women's lives impossible, begging
   the question: who belongs in academia and who does not? With careful
   attention to how the personal is always political, Reyes
   unapologetically deploys women of color feminisms to expose the
   normalized structures of gendered, classed, and racialized violences
   cloaked by disciplinary metrics of success. This page-turner of a book
   will resonate with those who are marginalized by the academy and those
   who are complicit with its operations. This book embodies
   intersectional public scholarship at its finest."

   —Ghassan Moussawi, author of Disruptions Situations

   "Not everyone is an equal citizen in the country of academia. Writing
   from within the borderlands of higher education in Academic Outsider,
   sociologist and professor Victoria Reyes describes with courage,
   insight, and heart about what the Ivory Tower's shadow hides. This book
   is must-read for anyone who truly cares about equality and
   inclusiveness in the academy."

   —Grace Talusan, author of The Body Papers

   "Academic Outsider is the kind of book that sticks with you. The kind
   of book that forces you to notice inequities and that would give you
   side-eye if you saw those inequities and tried to look away. The essays
   in Academic Outsider are poignant and sometimes painful to read. Yet,
   they are also poignant and painful in a way that leaves room for hope.
   The book inspires readers to recognize and embrace opportunities to
   resist the oppressive structures within academia and the oppressive
   structures that academia helps to perpetuate."

   —Jessica Calarco, author of A Field Guide to Grad School and
   Negotiating Opportunities

   The art of children, psychiatric patients and prisoners who create art
   outwith the conventional structures of art training and art production
   is often categorised as outsider art. In 1964 the French artist Jean
   Dubuffet started to collect artworks he considered to be free from
   societal constraints. This was termed art brut (raw art) – another term
   for outsider art – and in 1948 he founded the Compagnie de L’Art Brut
   with André Breton.

   The artist Ben Nicholson discovered the naïve painter Alfred Wallis in
   St Ives in the 1920s. A retired fisherman, Wallis painted pictures of
   ships and the town harbour on pieces of driftwood and cardboard.

   Summary.

   Coco Chanel, Steve Jobs, and Katalin Karikó were outsiders who defied
   the odds and produced revolutionary innovations. How do such outsiders
   succeed when so many others fail? The authors’ research uncovered four
   factors: (1) The outsiders were not outliers; they belonged to the
   system but hadn’t lost touch with its fringes. (2) An outsider had at
   least one insider who was willing to vouch for his or her ideas or
   abilities. (3) Outsiders leveraged “fracture points” — such as the
   death of a major gatekeeper. (4) Instead of just viewing their
   innovation as a technical challenge, they see it as a marketing
   challenge.

   Every once in a while, an outsider comes along with a new vision or a
   new way of doing things that revolutionizes a scientific field, an
   industry, or a culture. Take the case of Katalin Karikó, who defied all
   odds to pioneer the mRNA technology that ultimately gave the world
   Covid-19 vaccines in record time. Daughter of a butcher and raised in a
   small adobe house in the former Eastern bloc with no running water or
   refrigerator, Karikó started working with RNA as a student in Hungary
   but moved to the United States in her late twenties. For decades, she
   faced rejection after rejection, the scorn of colleagues, and even the
   threat of deportation. Yet today, Karikó’s foundational work on mRNA is
   at the heart of the vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna,
   and many researchers are now calling for Karikó to win the Nobel Prize.

   How did that happen? After 10 years of research, relying on a mix of
   qualitative techniques, large dataset analysis, and historical
   research, we have come up with four factors that explain the success of
   outsiders like Karikó. These factors do not have to be concomitant, and
   none is necessary, but each increases the odds substantially that an
   outsider will break through and their innovation will have a major
   impact.

1. Outsiders are not outliers.

   Our research suggests that successes like Karikó’s occur not just
   despite outsider status but because of it. Being less tied to the norms
   and standards to which insiders conform, outsiders recognize solutions
   that escape incumbents’ attention. Yet, the paradox is that the same
   social position that gives outsiders the perspective to pursue
   imaginative projects also constrains their ability to obtain support
   and recognition for their innovations. How do the innovations of
   outsiders like Karikó gain traction?

   The innovation pattern we observed in our research is very consistent.
   Outsiders typically innovate by acting on insights and experiences that
   are new to the context they enter but familiar to the context they come
   from. Consider Coco Chanel, the illegitimate daughter of a laundress
   and a street peddler. Abandoned and raised by nuns in an orphanage, she
   found in this humble context original inspiration for some of her most
   iconic design concepts. For example, her proverbial predilection for
   black and white is generally attributed to her prolonged exposure to
   the colors of the orphanage uniforms and the nuns’ tunics. Even the
   distinctive Chanel logo was an idea she gleaned from a simple
   stained-glass window of her orphanage, the Abbey of Aubazine.

   You would think that successful outsiders like Karikó and Chanel are
   statistical outliers, but we find this is not actually the case: In one
   of our studies, we analyzed the network of collaborations of
   approximately 12,000 Hollywood professionals to explore whether
   creative success is concentrated at the center of the system or at its
   margins. What we found surprised us: The most successful artists were
   not those at the extreme periphery of the network, the “renegades from
   the human race” — to borrow a label famously coined by Don Valentine,
   the pioneering venture capitalist who created Sequoia Capital, to
   describe Steve Jobs, when he first met him in the late 1970s. But
   neither were they “network kings” at the heart of their industry. The
   outsiders were not outliers: This study showed that the probability of
   creative success was highest in a border zone between the center and
   the periphery, by artists who belong to the system but have not lost
   touch with its fringes.

   Access to the center provides legitimacy while exposure to the fringe
   provides novelty. The combination of legitimacy and novelty produces
   impact. Statistically, the people most likely to succeed were those who
   kept one foot in Hollywood (where they could leverage resources,
   connections, and legitimacy) and the other foot on the edge (where they
   would encounter unfamiliar people, places, and habits).

2. Behind every Steve Jobs is a Mike Markkula, a champion on the inside.

   Thinking like an outsider can have advantages, but practicing the way
   of the outsider is complicated. Outsiders are strangers. They do not
   hold élite positions, and they have limited resources and lack the
   credentials of better-connected people whose theories or practices they
   are challenging. Not surprisingly, they often stay locked outside.

   Our research suggests that the outsider needs at least one insider who
   is willing to vouch for their ideas or abilities. In collaboration with
   Paul Allison, a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania
   Sociology, we went back to our Hollywood network and gathered new data
   on thousands of awards bestowed by two crucial audiences in this
   industry: critics and peers. Our statistical analyses revealed that
   critics were more likely to praise peripheral artists than insiders.
   Conversely, industry peers are more likely to favor their fellow
   insiders. From the outsider’s perspective, this means that one
   effective strategy to gain traction is to identify an audience — a
   person or a group of people — that has a cognitive or emotional
   affinity for the outsider or their ideas (as well as the credibility
   that the outsider usually lacks).

   Steve Jobs’s early career is a case in point. The VC industry
   repeatedly refused to support his project, but Jobs kept searching for
   a receptive audience. Finally, he met Mike Markkula, a wealthy young
   engineer who saw potential where the VC establishment saw only
   roadblocks. He made the first investment in Apple Computer. Why did
   Markkula support Jobs? Because his passion for technology and
   relatively young age gave him a stronger affinity with Jobs and his
   partner Steve Wozniak than most members of Silicon Valley’s investment
   community had. And with Markkula behind him, Jobs had the credibility
   he needed to attract more talent and money.

3. “Fracture points” let outsiders in.

   A third way outsiders break in is by leveraging what we call “fracture
   points” — events that generate intense stress on the system. One
   particular class of fracture points that we have been investigating
   reflects Max Planck’s famous quip that “an important scientific
   innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and
   converting its opponents: It rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul.
   What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out.” The idea is
   simple: When the gatekeepers die, they create space for the entrance of
   the new.

   In music, for instance, such moments happen after the death of a major
   artist. Working with Simone Santoni of City University of London, we
   assembled one of the world’s largest databases of musicians, songs, and
   music awards, as well as sudden deaths of superstars such as Michael
   Jackson or Prince. Regardless of the genre, in the years in which the
   system suffered a fracture point, the probability that a peripheral
   artist won a Grammy award increased by almost 40% while the chance that
   a central artist got it went down by 24%. The winning artist’s work
   also tended to be atypical in style compared to that of a more ordinary
   year.

4. Disruption is a marketing challenge that can be overcome.

   After being rejected by every major journal, Karikó’s breakthrough
   research was finally published in 2005. For years, however, it still
   got little attention. “We talked to pharmaceutical companies and
   venture capitalists. No one cared,” her research partner, Drew
   Weissman, recalled.

   Most established organizations and industries tend to reproduce the
   power and privilege structure of incumbent groups, reducing outsiders’
   chances of making their ideas heard and proving their worth. But our
   research suggests that outsiders should not be daunted: The very traits
   that make outsiders so disadvantaged within established occupational
   structures and professional categories are often precisely those
   required for the pursuit of exceptional entrepreneurial achievements in
   art, science, and business.

   Often, extraordinary outsiders’ primary problem is not their ideas but
   selling those ideas, precisely because of their disruptive
   implications. As the late Clayton Christensen noted in his 1997 book
   The Innovator’s Dilemma, “disruptive technology should be framed as a
   marketing challenge, not a technological one.”

   How to Build a Life

Find More Ways to Be an Outsider

   Doing so may feel painful, but it’s one of the best investments you
   will ever make.

   “How to Build a Life” is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling
   questions of meaning and happiness. Click here to listen to his podcast
   series on all things happiness, How to Build a Happy Life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The world is full of outsiders: students away at a university far from
   home, immigrants to a new country, and people who go abroad for work or
   extended travel. Over the past year, more than 4.4 million American
   workers quit their jobs in the “Great Resignation,” and many of them
   became outsiders by joining a different company or moving to a new
   place, which they perhaps imagined might be friendlier to their
   personal needs and tastes.

   But just because a journey to the unfamiliar was voluntary doesn’t make
   it easy: Being an outsider can be lonely and difficult, especially if
   all the strangers around you seem to know and understand one another.
   Your instincts might tell you that uprooting yourself was a terrible
   decision, that the benefits you sought are much smaller than the costs
   you are bearing. You might even wonder if you’ll ever be happy again.

   The truth is, however, you almost certainly did not make a mistake.
   There is little evidence that being an outsider creates long-term
   problems for happiness or lowers your chance of success; on the
   contrary, people thrust between places and cultures tend to develop
   strength, flexibility, and resiliency. Being an outsider may be one of
   the best investments you will ever make, and you should embrace it,
   pain and all.

   Scholars have studied outsiders, including immigrants, refugees,
   students, and foreign workers, to understand the long-term effects on
   well-being and personal success. Some of the most illuminating work has
   focused on so-called third-culture kids (TCKs): children who grow up
   outside their parents’ home culture and, as a result, are influenced
   partially by their parents’ home culture and partially by the culture
   in which they live, but mostly relate to a “third culture” made up of
   fellow sojourners. The term was coined in the 1960s by the sociologists
   Ruth Hill Useem and John Useem in studies of people who grow up in, for
   example, missionary and military families.

   A lot of older theories of philosophy and psychiatry would predict
   tough outcomes for outsiders, especially TCKs—and indeed, would
   recommend against being one if you can avoid it. In Laws, Plato argued
   that people should not even travel abroad before age 40, and that
   visitors be restricted to port areas of cities to minimize their
   contact with citizens. He believed that acculturation—the psychological
   change that occurs when a person blends into an unfamiliar culture—was
   damaging to one’s sense of self. Plato’s reasoning carried on into the
   mid-20th century, and was shared by such eminent psychologists as
   Abraham Maslow, Erik Erikson, and Carl Rogers.

   Read: Find the place you love. Then move there.

   Outsiders do tend to face particular genres of hardships, especially
   distrust by insiders. Despite the biblical injunction “Do not oppress a
   foreigner,” even believers often disregard friendliness in favor of
   tribal instinct when it comes to immigrants. You don’t have to move to
   a new place to feel the ill effects. People at the margins of society,
   by virtue of the language they speak or the lifestyle they choose,
   often bear the brunt of hostility. Joseph Stalin, for example, felt a
   particular animosity for the people he and his supporters called
   “rootless cosmopolitans”—generally, Jewish intellectuals, who he
   considered to live outside of mainstream Soviet society despite the
   fact that they lived in Soviet cities.

   However, with all due respect to Plato, outsiders can actually do very
   well. True, they generally suffer somewhat in the short term after a
   move. For example, one recent study showed that international college
   students rated their life satisfaction about 4 percent lower at the end
   of their first semester than at the beginning of the term. But a
   mountain of evidence shows that in the long run, being an outsider
   predicts well-being and emotional strength; it may even protect against
   depression.

   For example, one 2018 study in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology
   showed that TCKs grow up to be happier and more resilient than their
   peers who possess less multicultural experience, and are less prone to
   age-related declines in cognitive flexibility. A 2012 review found that
   being raised in at least two cultures leads, on average, to greater
   psychological and emotional well-being and higher social competence in
   adulthood. Also in 2013, scholars found that acculturation is
   negatively associated with depression, anxiety, psychological distress,
   and sadness.

   Furthermore, TCKs don’t usually wind up insecure; they develop multiple
   cultural identities that they employ flexibly, the same way they switch
   between languages. This is almost like a superpower in a globalized,
   fast-changing world.

   Spending time as an outsider is like any other big, taxing investment
   you can make in yourself: difficult and maybe painful, but with a
   positive, lifelong payoff. You might think of it as less like a fun
   vacation, and more akin to a voluntary personal challenge, like
   training for a triathlon. Here are a few ideas to incorporate an
   outsider ethos into your life.

1. Remember that being an outsider is a feature, not a bug.

   When you are new to a place or a group of people, you might be tempted
   to think of your unfamiliarity as a cost of doing business, and
   something to get over as quickly as possible. And by all means, you
   should make friends, learn the language, and find common ground. But
   don’t forget that the uncomfortable friction that occurs while you are
   integrating is making you stronger and more resilient. No pain, no
   gain.

   From the April 2020 issue: The perks of being a weirdo

2. Find regular ways to be an outsider.

   Given the benefits of bicultural experiences, don’t leave your outsider
   status up to circumstance. Find opportunities to be on the margins,
   looking in. In my profession of academia, for instance, we regularly
   take sabbaticals and go someplace completely new for a year or six
   months. Most people don’t have this luxury, but they can do something
   akin to it by changing jobs every few years, or transferring between
   cities. If that sounds too drastic, you can try switching up your
   regular haunts—go to a new church, club, or gym where you know no one.

3. Make friends with outsiders, even if you aren’t one.

   Remember that the third culture of TCKs is the one they form together
   as outsiders. Although no studies that I could find have looked at the
   therapeutic benefits of this third culture per se, it stands to reason
   that such bonding is crucial to the outsider’s superior adjustment
   capacity; it is a way to practice creating one’s own culture
   spontaneously. Even if you aren’t an outsider, you can learn these
   skills by joining those in your community who are. Look for the new
   people in your workplace or town, who are probably hanging out
   together. There’s always room for one more.

   In candor, I’m approaching this topic with a fair amount of bias. Being
   an outsider early in my adulthood was the most positive experience I
   have ever had. At 25, I moved to a foreign country where I didn’t speak
   a word of the language, and knew not one soul save for a woman I hoped
   to marry, but who spoke little English. It was brutal, but
   life-changing in the best way. After a few years, I had lost my fear of
   new things, whether it was an unfamiliar language, working with
   strangers, new love, or a community hostile to foreigners.

   Read: A once-in-a-lifetime chance to start over

   That woman became my wife, and subsequently became an outsider in the
   United States. Over the past 30 years we have moved many times, as have
   our now-adult TCKs. Our youngest, who is adopted from China, attended
   three high schools during an especially peripatetic period in our
   family, and then chose a college in Pamplona, Spain. The changes were
   hard at first, but she is flourishing, just as the data would predict.

   While portrayals of immigrants and their descendants in France and
   throughout Europe often center on burning cars and radical
   Islam, Citizen Outsider: Children of North African Immigrants in
   France paints a different picture. Through fieldwork and interviews in
   Paris and its banlieues, Jean Beaman examines middle-class and upwardly
   mobile children of Maghrébin, or North African immigrants. By showing
   how these individuals are denied cultural citizenship because of their
   North African origin, she puts to rest the notion of a French
   exceptionalism regarding cultural difference, race, and ethnicity and
   further centers race and ethnicity as crucial for understanding
   marginalization in French society.

Reviews

     "Written in a straightforward and engaging style, ... ideal, not
     only for specialists of race and (im)migration in France and beyond,
     but also as a teaching tool for upper level undergraduate
     students."—Ethnic and Racial Studies

     “Offers a critical examination of a so-called colorblind society. A
     solid addition to courses on race, immigration, citizenship, or
     French studies.”—Migration Studies Review

     "A compelling case study for very real challenges facing France
     today."—Sociology of Race and Ethnicity

     "Both the empirical evidence and the theoretical frameworks that
     Beaman employs make important contributions to political and
     scholarly debates over race and immigration in France."—City and
     Community

     "Beaman offers a rich and stringent critique of the continued
     marginalization of French citizens deemed “outsiders” due
     to their race or ethnicity. ... This book is an excellent case study
     of race and immigration in France, suitable for scholars of race and
     ethnicity, and particularly well-suited for senior undergraduate
     students."—American Journal of Sociology

     "I highly recommend this monograph for classroom use in an
     upper-division undergraduate course in race-ethnicity or in a
     graduate-level seminar in race-ethnicity or stratification. I
     recommend this book to those who want a nuanced understanding of how
     immigration, ethnicity, race, and culture frame social inclusion for
     visible minorities in France today. Read this book cover to cover.
     Beaman delivers a sophisticated yet accessible comprehension of why
     the children of North African immigrants in France grow up to be
     citizen outsiders."—Social Forces

     "A methodologically sound, illuminating text that contributes to the
     literature on both immigration and the formation of racial theories
     at the global level."—Teaching Sociology

     "A well-crafted intervention, Citizen Outsider complicates
     discourses surrounding assimilation, integration, and European
     racial politics. . . . Discussions of migration sometimes shy away
     from explicitly naming the racist exclusionary practices which
     underpin the nation state, here Beaman triumphs by entirely centring
     the topic."—European Journal of Cultural and Political Sociology

   "Citizen Outsider takes place in a new thread of research on
   multicultural France. It's a fantastic journey into the minority
   experience of socially upwardly mobile North Africans. It uncovers the
   French 'racial project' and contributes brilliantly to an ongoing
   conversation on racial formation in a formally colorblind society. It
   is worth reading to take stock on racial formation in France."—Patrick
   Simon, Institut National d’Etudes Démographiques (National Institute
   for Demographic Studies), coeditor of Fear, Anxiety, and National
   Identity: Immigration and Belonging in North America and Western Europe

   "Jean Beaman's Citizen Outsider offers a trenchant analysis of the
   racial exclusions, indignities, and injustices experienced by French
   citizens of color. Distinguishing between formal and cultural
   citizenship, Beaman draws on extensive ethnographic evidence and
   interviews to substantiate the insight that physical presence falls
   significantly short of social belonging or acceptance. She traces the
   historical and material conditions underpinning the resulting racial
   tensions and political unsettlements. Citizen Outsider provides a
   compelling account of the social structures and expressions of racism
   in France today—and their individual and community resistances."—David
   Theo Goldberg, Director and Professor, University of California
   Humanities Research Institute, and author of Are We All Postracial Yet?
   "Whites in France lie to themselves and the world by proclaiming that
   they do not have institutional racism in their nation. Relying on
   interviews with second-generation, middle-class North African
   immigrants (a group that should be presumably 'integrated' and thus
   happy), Professor Beaman shatters this myth and shows the deep salience
   of race in the country. Bravo to Professor Beaman for clearly
   documenting how 'racism without racists' operates in the French
   context!"—Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, president of American Sociological
   Association and author of Racism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism
   and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America
   "Citizen Outsider brilliantly illuminates the significance of
   ethnoracial origins in France, a society whose national identity denies
   their importance. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants
   to understand the role of immigration in the widening social cleavages
   on both sides of the Atlantic."—Richard Alba, coauthor of Strangers No
   More: Immigration and the Challenges of Integration in North America
   and Western Europe

   "France's supposed colorblind Republican ideology has often led
   scholars to overlook or even ignore the complexities of race in France.
   Jean Beaman's work is an important contribution to the study of
   immigration and race in France, bringing the voices of
   second-generation North Africans into the debates around what it means
   to be French and what it means to be Maghrébin/Black at a time when the
   politics of immigration are creating volatile situations in
   the banlieus (suburbs) of France and fueling support for Far Right
   politicians. Beaman's contribution comes at a critical juncture in the
   study of immigration, race, and politics in Europe and should be read
   by students and scholars alike."—Terri E. Givens, Provost, Menlo
   College, and coauthor of Legislating Equality: The Politics of
   Antidiscrimination Policy in Europe
   "Skillfully combining attention to microlevel interaction and to the
   broader social environment, Jean Beaman offers a rich and provocative
   analysis of the cultural marginalization experienced by children of
   North African immigrants in France. She convincingly shows how
   ethnicity continues to separate individuals who have attained
   middle-class status, and how educational and occupational attainment
   can still leave some communities at the margins of society. She reveals
   the subtle and less subtle legacies of racial and ethnic inequalities
   inherited from a history of colonialism. This is a major and innovative
   contribution to the study of citizenship and immigration, a must-read
   for anyone interested in the topic."—Mounira M. Charrad, author of
   States and Women’s Rights: The Making of Postcolonial Tunisia, Algeria,
   and Morocco
   One beautiful part of this book is captured in the words of the people
   interviews because Jean Beaman largely supports her arguments with
   portraits and excerpts of interviews with those whom she calls
   ‘outside’ citizens, in reference to work conceptualizing the
   simultaneous dynamics of integration and social marginalization to
   explain the place of black minorities in American society … Despite
   trajectories that have allowed them to access higher education and
   positions in intermediate or managerial professions, the visibility of
   their social and cultural heritage and the representations associated
   with it in French society lead to discrimination which is more or less
   strong, coupled with a permanent questioning of their legitimacy to
   occupy positions of responsibility in the workplace … Through an
   analysis of identity experiences and discrimination of young adults of
   North African origin who grew up in France, Jean Beaman shows the
   duality, the complexity, and the situational nature of their
   belonging."—Anne-Laure Counilh, University of Poitiers

                'Andor' Highlights What Being an Outsider Means

   By Emily Kavanagh
   Published Sep 27, 2022

   We don't always find a place to belong.

   star-wars-andor-diego-luna-social-featured Image via Disney+

   Editor's Note: The following article contains spoilers from Episodes
   1-3 of Andor.Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) didn’t ask to be in the Empire.
   We know this now more than ever with the first few episodes of Andor.
   Though Rogue One made Cassian’s disdain for the Empire clear, through
   Andor we’re starting to see where that fire came from. Cassian was from
   Kenari, a mid-rim planet with little Empire activity. He lived in a
   village of people who had never seen a spacecraft before, had their own
   language and culture, and a family of his own. For the beginning of his
   life, Cassian quite literally existed outside the Star Wars world we
   know and love. But his status as an outsider ignorant to the larger
   plights of the galaxy does not last long. After he’s whisked away from
   his home in a bid to save him from Imperial forces, he’s forced into
   the world of the Galactic Empire and forced to deal with the
   consequences of it.

   Cassian Andor is an outsider in a different way than most of the other
   Star Wars protagonists we’ve encountered. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)
   feels like an outsider at the start but his bloodline and use of the
   Force make it clear that that outsider status was only ever going to be
   temporary. Even the Mandalorian, Dinn Djarin (Pedro Pascal), lacks some
   outsider status due to his place within the Mandalorians and his
   familial bond with Grogu. These kinds of people have direct connections
   to the Jedi and the Empire in a way that makes it almost impossible for
   them to not get involved. But Cassian isn’t called to great purpose
   through destiny or connection, he chooses it. As an outsider, he had no
   choice but to be brought into the world of the Empire and everything it
   entails but without any firm connections to it, Cassian is also able to
   navigate the world differently than many others.

Being an Outsider for Andor Leaves You On the Outskirts of Community

   andor-season-1-episode-3-diego-luna-social-feature Image via Disney+

   Being an outsider can entail a lot of things and as we see with
   Cassian, there are a lot of negatives that can come from that. Being an
   outsider makes others suspicious of you. There’s a sense of safety
   found in commonalities so when differences are detected they can become
   an unjust cause for targeting. In the very first scene of the show,
   Cassian is questioned by the guards at the bar and later harassed by
   them because he seems out of place. Though his race isn’t listed as
   Kenari anywhere, his so-called “dark features” and accent still cause
   others to scrutinize him unfairly like Bix’s (Adria Arjona) boyfriend
   Tomm (James McArdle) who eyes Cassian with suspicion and even tips off
   the Pre-Mor officers to his whereabouts. We see through Andor how being
   an outsider can put one in a particularly vulnerable position where
   they can easily be made into a victim or a perpetrator just through
   means of survival.

   His status as an outsider means Cassian is often in constant danger
   because he is not only beholden to his own actions but also to how they
   may be perceived by others. But this outsider status is not without its
   merits. Others who find themselves on the fringes like Bix or Maarva
   (Fiona Shaw) will band together with Cassian despite or even because of
   his differences because there is a sense of solidarity in that
   struggle. People who live on the fringes of society must work together
   to ensure their survival. Cassian may be an outsider, but he’s not a
   soldier yet and so the civilians, knowingly or not, help him to evade
   the Pre-Mor.

   There’s also undoubtedly value in differences, in the perspective of an
   outsider, something Luthen (Stellan Skarsgård) seems to believe in
   particular as he went out of his way to recruit Cassian.

   Their Influences

Cassian Uses His Status as Outsider to His Advantage

   andor-episode-3-cassian-luthen-social-featured Image via Disney+

   Being seen as different also means you’re likely to be underestimated
   and Cassian has used that to his advantage, explaining in Episode 3 how
   he’s been able to steal so many parts from Imperial ships because he
   simply does his best to look unassuming. The Empire believes they’re
   too smart to be duped by someone like him, and he uses that to his
   advantage. Being underestimated allows Cassian to navigate the world in
   different ways than others. In a world that is constantly
   underestimating you, it can be easy to fade into the shadows or become
   jaded, but it’s his connections to others on the fringes and his
   determination to find his sister, another outsider, that gives him this
   different way of navigating the world. If he’s unable to achieve his
   goals through conventional means, he’ll use back channels and that’s
   what makes him particularly qualified to be a rebel spy.

   Being an outsider may attract the attention of the in-crowd, but it
   also draws the attention of other outsiders. The Imperial officers may
   have shot at the Kenari on sight but Maarva goes out of her way to save
   Cassian because she knows he’ll be killed if more officers show up.
   Some people will see outsiders not as a danger but as unwitting
   participants in something beyond their control. Cassian finds
   friendship, support, and solidarity in the connections he makes with
   others working outside the system to survive. And this mirrors the
   formation of the Rebel Alliance on a microscale. People who have been
   subjugated by the Empire joining hands and operating outside of
   established channels. Outsiders are, by nature, a threat to the status
   quo and when they band together they’re capable of a reckoning.

   Andor offers us insight into what being an outsider means. It’s a
   dangerous and vulnerable position but also makes the outsiders
   themselves a danger. They’re able to see things more clearly from the
   outside and subvert assumptions to their own ends whether that be
   something as simple as sneaking onto ships to steal parts or as
   complicated as helping take down the Empire. Outsiders are a threat
   because they aren’t beholden to the status quo, in fact, they’re often
   victims of it like Cassian, and this puts them in a unique position to
   see the world for what it is and enact change. In coming episodes,
   we’ll likely see just what an “outsider” is capable of as we watch
   Cassian transform from someone struggling to stay alive to the
   hard-headed rebel we know from Rogue One.

The Creole Cocktail's Outsider Origins

   By Autumn Swiers/Dec. 1, 2022 4:01 pm EST

   When you think about New Orleans cuisine, dishes like Bouillabaisse,
   gumbo, crawfish, jambalaya, beignets, Po boys, or classic red beans and
   rice might come to mind. Mark Twain himself once famously said, "New
   Orleans food is as delicious as the less criminal forms of sin." But,
   what does the city offer to drink? Introducing, the Creole Cocktail:
   the New Orleans bevy you've probably never heard of.

   There's a version of the Creole Cocktail recipe printed in W.C.
   Whitfield's 1939 book "Just Cocktails," per The Spruce Eats, so folks
   have been enjoying it for a while. But, don't let the name deceive you
   — the Creole Cocktail didn't come from New Orleans. Ben Hatch, beverage
   director at New Orleans' Elysian Bar, says that hasn't stopped the
   cocktail from enjoying wild popularity amongst Louisiana sippers.

   "New Orleans is such a boozy town that people aren't afraid to pull up
   a bar stool when it's 110 degrees outside," says Hatch, via PUNCH.
   "They order a very spirit-forward cocktail like this and enjoy it just
   as much."

   So, what exactly are the Creole Cocktail's outsider origins? And how
   did it come to be associated with The Big Easy?

The spirit of The Big Apple in The Big Easy

   According to Neal Bodenheimer, author of "Cure: New Orleans Drinks and
   How to Mix 'Em" via PUNCH, the Creole Cocktail was created by a New
   York City-based mixologist called Hugo Ensslin. Ensslin immigrated to
   NYC from Germany, and the Big Apple had at least as much influence on
   Ensslin's creation as New Orleans, says Bodenheimer. The Creole
   Cocktail is equal parts rye whiskey and sweet vermouth, stirred with
   Bénédictine and Amer Picon.

   The most "New Orleans" thing about the drink, says the outlet, is the
   French Bénédictine and Amer Picon ingredients. Bénédictine is a spiced,
   herbal liqueur with top notes of citrus and pine. Amer Picon is a
   mildly bitter liqueur that's wicked popular among French mixologists,
   says David Lebovitz, and it's nearly impossible to get outside of
   France. If you're struggling to get it yourself, Saveur recommends
   substituting a dash or two of Angostura bitters for Amer Picon.

   These French liqueurs narrowly separate the Creole Cocktail from the
   classic Manhattan cocktail, which aligns with Ensslin's alleged
   subliminal piety to New York City. But, his creation is nearly
   indistinguishable from the lesser-known Brooklyn Cocktail, which
   features rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, maraschino, and Amer Picon, per
   Liquor.com. The lineup of ingredients is almost identical — which, we
   guess, means the Creole Cocktail must be a pretty fail-safe drink for
   mixologists to keep in their back pockets.

Avinash Tiwary wants to support outsiders entering industry: I wish there was

   Actor Avinash Tiwary is not chasing fame but longevity to fulfil his
   personal mission of creating a space to support outsider entering the
   entertainment industry.

   He reasons, “I want to live the bandwidth to be the best of the good
   and the worst of the bad. I want to have longevity in this field. If
   I’m able to sustain for a long period of time, that means I’ll be doing
   things right. And only then I’d be able to survive this competitive
   market.”

   The actor, who was recently seen in web show Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,
   is passionate about supporting outsiders and he calls it a “personal
   matter”.

   Looking back, he tells us, “I’ve been acting since 2003. This is my
   19th year [in showbiz], and throughout this period, starting at a very
   early age, I’ve always felt that I wish someone was there to guide me,
   because sometimes you’re just left in space when you don’t know
   anything. Everything that you’ve done is carve your own way through
   it.”

   However, Laila Majnu and Bulbbul actor is quick to add that whatever he
   has done so far comes with a great sense of pride. “I won’t deny it.
   I’m an egotistical man and it does feed that part of me. But I maintain
   that there are so many times I just felt that someone told me how to go
   about things. Humme nahi mila toh ab lagta hai ke durson ko dena
   chahiye humein,” he continues, “I want to get to a point in life where
   I can do things for the outsiders, I hope that happens. If that
   happens, then there’ll be more space for outsiders to come because we
   have created that way for them.”

   Over the years, there is a section of his fans who feel the actor still
   hasn’t got the right due in the industry. Mention this, and he says he
   doesn’t have any qualms or complaints.

   “The way I look at it is to be deserving of what you desire. And if I
   don’t have what I desire then it is only because I have not become
   deserving of it. So there’s a long way to go. I’m glad that people
   think that I should deserve more. I hope it stays. And I’m doing every
   bit possible to ensure that, but I think I’m not ready yet, which is
   why it hasn’t come to me,” he ends.

From outsider to insider: Cabinet minister Kris Austin on the year he went
mainstream

   Kris Austin says he has not changed, but the politics surrounding him
   have — and the New Brunswick cabinet minister believes they’re moving
   in his direction.

People’s Alliance founder turned PC minister says his goals and strategy have
not changed

   Kris Austin says he has not changed, but the politics surrounding him
   have — and he believes they're moving in his direction.

   The former People's Alliance leader's defection to the Progressive
   Conservatives in March was a stunning moment in New Brunswick politics
   this year.

   But he argues it made sense given his goal remains the same in 2022 as
   it was when he founded the Alliance in 2010: to nudge the party system
   into giving New Brunswickers a sharper contrast and a clearer choice.

   "I think there needs to be a separate distinct ideology between the two
   [mainstream political parties], and back then I didn't see it quite
   like I do today," the Fredericton-Grand Lake MLA and minister of public
   safety said during an in-depth interview with CBC News.

   supporters. (Jacques Poitras/CBC)

   "Today I feel there is a little more of a difference between the two,
   and I think we played a part in that, which I think is good and
   positive in the long term."

   Now, as a member of an internal PC government working group studying
   how to update the Official Languages Act, he's an even more polarizing
   figure than he was as leader of a small populist party.

   In a wide-ranging 45-minute discussion, Austin said he is pragmatic
   about what he can achieve as part of a mainstream political party.

   But this is still better than irrelevance, he said.

Winning some battles better than opposition

   "Maybe you win 50 per cent of the time, maybe you win 70 per cent of
   the time," he said.

   "The alternative was to sit in the opposition and win none of the time
   and not be able to see any change in New Brunswick that you want to
   see."

   Austin said he understands how his switch from the Alliance, which he
   made with fellow party MLA Michelle Conroy, upset many supporters.

   with Austin. (Jacques Poitras/CBC)

   "They were very passionate over the years, and I know some of them are
   disappointed in the decision I made," he said.

   "It's about effectiveness. How do we be effective and how do we really
   make change? Otherwise I feel like we're just wasting time. And I'm not
   one for wasting time."

No 'ultimatums' on language law changes

   What kind of influence Austin will have on an update to the Official
   Languages Act has emerged as a key question for many francophones leery
   of his position on bilingualism.

   He has long insisted he supports official bilingualism but questions
   some aspects of its implementation — a disingenuous distinction in the
   eyes of Acadian activists.

   Liberal and Green MLAs want him removed from the internal working
   group, worried he'll weaken institutions created to protect
   minority-language francophone rights.
     * Austin faces tough questions on language at PC party meeting

     * Premier defends decision to put Kris Austin on languages committee

   Austin believes the post of commissioner of official languages, created
   in 2002, and the two language-based health authorities, established in
   2008, are not needed to meet the goal of the original 1969 Official
   Languages Act: equal service to the public in both languages.

   Last month, his cabinet colleague Daniel Allain said keeping those
   institutions was "non-negotiable" for him as a francophone, and he'd
   vote against any move to eliminate them.

   Austin said he will not draw any similar lines in the sand.

   "Whatever government decides as a whole, you're part of government," he
   said. "I don't like to operate on ultimatums."

Cabinet minister Kris Austin talks about his role in revising the Official
Languages Act

   27 days ago
   Duration 2:24
   Kris Austin sat down for an in-depth interview about his time as
   People’s Alliance leader and his move to the Progressive Conservatives.

Austin founded Alliance after losing PC nomination

   Austin ran for the PC nomination in the riding of Grand Lake-Gagetown
   for the 2010 election.

   He lost, and rather than stick with the party and wait for another
   opportunity, he founded the Alliance.

   "I wanted to do something new. I wanted to do something that I felt
   would give more openness to the political spectrum."

   The PCs and Liberals had become "a little too similar," in his view. He
   felt voters needed a distinct right-of-centre option.

   The early years were a slog, with few encouraging signs — until the
   2014 election.

Narrow 2014 loss encouraged him to press on

   In that campaign he came within 25 votes of winning the new
   Fredericton-Grand Lake riding.

   "I think it would have been different if I had lost with a much larger
   margin. It was really that 25-vote spread that told me that we can
   continue to build and see some growth."

   By 2018 several language-rights controversies were brewing, including a
   cut in work hours for a unilingual commissionaire at the government's
   Chancery Place office building and a number of bilingual paramedic
   positions that couldn't be filled.

   The Alliance won three seats, including Austin's.

   He said there's no denying language issues played a role in the
   breakthrough.

   "Pretty much everybody" supports the idea of bilingualism, Austin said,
   but Alliance voters didn't want it implemented in a way that would
   "leave anybody out in the cold."

Liberals 'aggressively' sought Alliance support in 2018, Austin says

   The Liberals lost their majority in that election and won one fewer
   seat than the PCs. Premier Brian Gallant tried to hang on to power,
   convening the legislature in the hopes of winning a confidence vote
   with the support of smaller parties.

   Gallant worked "aggressively" to win him over, Austin revealed.

   "There was no hard offer on the table but the door was always open, you
   know," he said. "'Should you decide to at least open the door to that,
   we could talk about different things.'"
     * Cardy says several PC MLAs oppose Austin's role on language
       committee

     * Top Acadian minister outlines 'non-negotiable' stance on
       bilingualism

   Many Liberal MLAs elected with Gallant in 2018 now want Premier Blaine
   Higgs to drop Austin from the language law working group.

   The Alliance voted against the Liberals, leading to the defeat of their
   government and Higgs's ascent to the premier's office — with Austin
   holding the balance of power.

Alliance worked quietly to influence PC policy

   Austin adopted a quiet approach to take advantage of his leverage and
   advance his agenda.

   At a 2019 public accounts committee meeting, officials from Ambulance
   New Brunswick said no ambulance had ever been taken out of service
   because of a lack of bilingual paramedics.

   Austin was at the committee session but opted not to use the forum to
   challenge the officials or ask questions on the issue.

   Similarly, he never introduced a bill to amend the Official Languages
   Act.

   Drafting a bill would require a lot of specialized expertise from a
   party still learning the ropes at the legislature, he explained.

   He preferred to work behind the scenes with Higgs to get Medavie Health
   Services to reorganize the ambulance service to address vacancies. The
   government also reclassified paramedic positions, which gave them
   higher pay.

2020 setback left Austin at 'crossroads' about party's future

   Despite those successes, the Alliance suffered two setbacks in the next
   election in 2020: one of its three MLAs was defeated, and the PCs
   gained a majority.

   "I was at this crossroads," Austin said.

   The party's leverage was gone. At the same time, donations and members
   were dropping off, in part, Austin believes, because voters saw the PCs
   under Higgs adopting some Alliance policies.

   "One of the key elements for me was, 'What is the current government
   doing?' and 'If they're doing a lot of what we're saying, why are we
   doing what we're doing?'" he said. "Why can't we just join that and try
   to be a part of that and see growth in New Brunswick?"

   The founder of the People’s Alliance says he’s succeeded in giving New
   Brunswickers a clearer choice when they cast their ballots.

   Austin also said he was exhausted after 12 years travelling the
   province as a party leader, giving up precious family time.

   He and Conroy announced their move to the Tories on March 30.

No promise of cabinet post when he defected to PCs, Austin says

   Defecting to the PCs meant Austin lost the $19,750 salary he got as
   leader of an official party in the legislature on top of his $85,000
   annual MLA pay.
   [education-minister-dominic-cardy-sept-2-2021.jpg]
   Dominic Cardy recently tweeted that Austin told education officials he
   met in the spring that he would not support 'anything that forces
   French down people's throats.' (CBC/Facebook)

   He made the jump without any promise from Higgs of a cabinet position
   and salary down the road, he said.

   "There was no commitment to say, 'Look, this is what I want' and 'This
   is what you're going to get.' I did say, 'I want to be a part of this,
   not just on the outside looking in.' But there was no hard commitment."

   Austin said he and Conroy got a "very cordial" welcome from the PC
   caucus, including ministers Daniel Allain and Dominic Cardy, despite
   clear disagreements on key issues.

   "Even with Minister Allain, we've had discussions and I feel no
   animosity, personal or otherwise, with him, and I hope he doesn't."

Says he wants to improve his French-language skills

   Cardy recently tweeted that Austin told education officials he met in
   the spring that he would not support "anything that forces French down
   people's throats."

   Austin said he doesn't remember saying that. He said he told officials
   he did not want increased French instruction for non-immersion students
   coming at the expense of math, science and "some of the other basics."

   In October, Austin was sworn into cabinet as public safety minister.

   no animosity, personal or otherwise with him, and I hope he doesn't.'

   The rookie minister said he now hopes to improve his own French skills.

   "That is something I do want to work on. There's no question learning a
   second language is a difficult task, especially the older you get.… But
   I acknowledge I do have to do a little bit better in terms of at least
   getting some basic understanding of the language."

   He also wouldn't rule out running for the PC leadership someday.

   "I leave all options on the table. I don't want to box myself in one
   way or the other."

'My objective was accomplished'

   Reflecting on the last 12 years, the one-time populist outsider
   believes he has moved the PCs to a place where there is now a "clear
   distinction" with the Liberals.

   "I think my objective was accomplished to a certain degree in that
   regard."

   Still, he doesn't feel he needs a clear win on language policy, one of
   his old party's signature issues, to prove his point.

   He believes he, Allain and others on the language working group can
   reach a consensus everyone can accept — but that still bears his
   imprint.

   "This is about how do we find that middle ground? How do I ensure that
   at least some of my ideas on public policy, whatever it is, can be
   brought to table and be part of that change?" he said.

   "Again, you're not going to win every battle, but I know that I'm more
   effective where I am now than where I would be had I not made this
   move."

'Constant feeling of being an outsider': The experience of minority
humanities professors

   The total percentage of faculty and academic staff of color at Michigan
   State University is 28.9%. For faculty members like public affairs
   professor Ramya Swayamprakash, the lack of diversity can be isolating.

   “It’s just (a) constant feeling of being an outsider, having to prove
   that I belong here,” Swayamprakash said. “And it oftentimes leads to an
   imposter syndrome, which is really hard to sort of break out (of). I
   don’t think a lot of my white colleagues have to ever think or engage
   in those sorts of thoughts on an everyday, existential level.”

   Swayamprakash said being a woman of color disadvantages her on a
   regular basis, particularly with colleagues casting doubt on her
   abilities.

   “(My white colleagues) question my native tongue, which is English,”
   Swayamprakash said. “Because I’m a minority, I don’t speak ‘American.’
   … These kinds of things, especially in the work environment, can be
   detrimental to anybody, because then other people begin to see you as
   not so capable because you don’t speak the right way.” ﻿

   International relations professor Robert Brathwaite is Vietnamese and
   Black. He said this phenomenon happens to students of color as well and
   can lead to feeling inadequate. He feels like he can't make any
   mistakes and having a multiracial background can perpetuate the feeling
   of estrangement from his white counterparts.

   Comparative culture and politics professor Sejuti Das Gupta, who is
   Indian, said she feels pressured to validate or prove her knowledge.

   “I had to learn I was competing with my white colleagues that probably
   have been a part of the system for a much longer time,” Das Gupta said.
   “That was definitely a disadvantage for me. Initially, for two years, I
   put in extra hours of work.”

   Das Gupta said an especially challenging moment of pushback was when
   students found her accent hard to understand, which she didn't know how
   to control. An accent, she said, is how a minority speaks a language.

   Spanish and cultural studies professor Claudia Berrios-Campos is
   Peruvian and Latina. She said stereotypes associated with different
   racial and ethnic backgrounds can permeate her relationships with
   students. Often, she said, others are surprised by her education. ﻿

   “(They’re) really impressed that I even managed to get a degree,”
   Berrios-Campus said. “They assumed by default that I didn’t have access
   to great education, but I am fortunate to say that I did. It’s not the
   same story for a lot of Peruvians, but I had a very good and diverse
   education.” ﻿

   Berrios-Campos also said she noticed a difference in the way her
   students receive her expertise as a woman of color. When she gave
   comments about the role of U.S. colonial structures in her Latino
   American literature class, she said she received "attitude" from
   students. ﻿

   "Almost like, ‘Who are you to talk about American politics?’"
   Berrios-Campos said. "I’m a professor!”

   Swayamprakash has experienced difficulty trying to connect with her
   students as well, as a direct result of her race.

   “I do think there is a fair degree of resistance to somebody who
   doesn’t speak like Americans, and I don’t think it’s malicious,”
   Swayamprakash said. “I think it’s just creatures of habit. Having
   somebody new who doesn’t look like, speak like you can be challenging.
   I've had my fair share of students who don’t like my face because of
   the way I talk, because I’m Indian.”

Lack of diversity in James Madison College presents challenges for students

   Amalia Medina

   Swayamprakash said students frequently assumed she studied a STEM
   subject rather than social science. Assumptions like these feed into
   the notion that humanities are less relevant than sciences,
   Barrios-Campos said.

   “The lack of seriousness is perceived,” Swayamprakash said. “The
   humanities have certain stigma on not being considered true
   contributions in the development of humanity. This always makes me very
   sad and a little angry.” ﻿

   Barrios-Campos said while subjects like biology, finance and medicine
   are essential facets of human progress, the humanities provide an extra
   element of future implications. These nuanced contributions, she said,
   have become increasingly important in the face of historical events
   like the pandemic, which has affected human contact.  ﻿

   “With sciences versus social sciences, there is a definite difference
   of acceptance,” Das Gupta said. “The other thing that I’ve experienced
   is … I was very passionate about doing field work. But when I would
   tell that to students … they made the decision that I chose that path
   because I was not good at philosophy or theory.” ﻿

   Even within social sciences, Das Gupta said, there is an assumed
   hierarchy: scholars that study theory are considered serious, while
   those that do field work can be perceived as less accomplished
   academically.

   The preconceptions surrounding minorities in humanities also affect
   academic endeavors beyond the classroom. Brathwaite said making
   professional connections can be difficult.

   For professors of color, networks may look different than that of their
   white colleagues. However, Brathwaite said, this is not necessarily a
   reflection of their competence, but rather the institutional structure
   that limits minorities’ access.﻿

   Das Gupta said there are a number of grants that professors cannot
   apply for if they are not citizens – which is a significant
   disadvantage for many minorities.

   “If you want to retain a diverse group of faculty, we need to think
   about, ‘How do we enable them to do that kind of work?’” Das Gupta
   said. “I don't think in this situation, having equal funding makes it
   equal. I think it needs to have an equal outcome.”

   In the midst of these issues, Brathwaite said, an arc of progress can
   be seen within academia.﻿

   “It seems like we’re moving beyond the conversation towards people
   understanding actions need to be taken," Brathwaite said. "Now, that
   still means these things need to be implemented. I think there’s a lot
   of work that still needs to happen.” ﻿

England-born Ike Ugbo hoping to shed ‘outsider’ label with goals for Canada

   Joshua Kloke
   Nov 14, 2022

   9

   The time on the clock was creeping into the wee morning hours where he
   was in Belgium, but after what Ike Ugbo had just witnessed on TV, he
   couldn’t sit still.

   At BMO Field in Toronto, the Canada men’s team had just come back to
   beat Panama 4-1 on the sixth matchday of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying
   with an entertaining, full-throttle approach. Qualifying for the World
   Cup for the first time since 1986 began to look like a possibility.

   With the sun starting to appear, Ugbo, 24, decided he wanted in on the
   experience. He fired off a text message to Canada centre-back Doneil
   Henry – five years Ugbo’s senior, but a familiar face because the two
   had grown up five minutes apart in Brampton, Ontario.

   “He was megging me when I was in grade five, and we used to beat him
   up,” said Henry, with a smile.

   Ugbo asked Henry how he could get involved in the Canada team. A
   talented product of the Chelsea academy, Ugbo had bounced around on
   loan deals, leading to questions about his long-term potential. Henry
   posed a question of his own in response to Ugbo’s text: Do you have the
   right mentality to play on this team?

   Ugbo insisted he did, so Henry passed the message over to Canada head
   coach John Herdman.

   Herdman had inquired about Ugbo’s availability to play for Canada early
   in his tenure as head coach, but was told by Chelsea staff that Ugbo
   was only interested in representing England after playing for several
   of their youth national teams. Still, Ugbo remained eligible to play
   for Canada. And as a vital forward in an attack-minded Canada squad,
   the World Cup could finally be the time for the AC Troyes man, long
   considered an outsider in Chelsea’s ranks and whose career has taken
   winding turns, to deliver on years of promise, and carve out a place
   for himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   When Ugbo closed his eyes and thought about being four years old and
   playing soccer in Brampton, two images came to mind.

   “Scoring a lot of goals,” he said with a smile. “And, our jerseys were
   sponsored by Tim Hortons.”

   Born in London, Ugbo moved to Canada with his mother and sisters while
   still in preschool. His father remained in the UK to work, but traveled
   between the two countries often. When his father was with him, he would
   regale his son with stories of the Nigeria team at the 1994 World Cup,
   who topped their group.

   As fate would have it, his family had moved to what would eventually
   become the soccer capital of Canada, home to some of the country’s best
   players,  including Atiba Hutchinson, Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan Osorio
   and, of course, Henry.

   “When I look back, I can see how much growth Canada has had, and how
   far Canada has come to where we are today,” said Ugbo.

   Eventually, the distance between the family became too great and Ugbo,
   then nine, and his family returned to England. Ugbo began playing
   recreationally there, but readily admits that, having grown up in
   Canada, he failed to understand just how deeply entrenched soccer is in
   England’s national psyche.

   Iceman, and a players’ strike

   After a few months playing as a midfielder in a friendly Sunday league,
   Ugbo was approached by a Chelsea scout offering a chance to train at
   their academy.

   “At the time, I didn’t see it as big as it was,” he said.

   He was playing as a No. 10, but after changes in the squad forced him
   to move to striker as a 16-year-old, he was able to stay in the
   position because of his natural instincts for finishing.

   “You learn different types of movements needed,” said Ugbo. “When I
   made the transition, I brought things that I had to use while playing
   in midfield. It just clicks well.”

   For the majority of his time in the Chelsea academy, highlighted by
   UEFA Youth League titles in 2015 and 2016, things clicked for him. He
   signed his first professional contract with Chelsea in 2015.

   But almost immediately, his eyes became bigger than his stomach. As a
   17-year-old he thought, I have to play first team football as soon as
   possible.

   “I was ready to learn everything from a young age, including the
   difficulties,” he said.

   Joining a Chelsea first team with Premier League and Champions League
   title aspirations wasn’t possible. His father wanted him to get outside
   of his comfort zone and go abroad. Instead, Ugbo went on loan with
   Barnsley in the EFL Championship. Regular playing time and goals did
   not come. The same was the case for his loan to League One side MK Dons
   for the second half of the 2017-18 season, as well as his loan to
   another League One side, Scunthorpe United, for 2018-19.

   He had rushed into his professional career, scoring just five goals
   across those three teams in his two seasons on loan.

   “It looked like maybe I wasn’t ready, and you could say that,” Ugbo
   said. “I was still a kid. I had to learn fast.”

   This shock was coupled with living away from home for the first time,
   and the new responsibilities he had to learn — be it maintaining a
   clean apartment or eating healthy. He struggled with the latter, to the
   point that it negatively impacted his performances.

   “Your body is asking for more than in Under-23’s football because the
   intensity is even higher,” he said. “It was a real shock to me at the
   time.”

   During his scoring drought and frequent moves, he wondered whether he’d
   succeed as a professional soccer player.

   “Sometimes there were doubts through the first two loans, for sure,” he
   said. “Like, ‘Where’s my level?’”

   Conversations with those closest to him all eventually came to the same
   conclusion: the teams he was trying to crack would not change their
   approach to fit Ugbo. Instead, he needed to better understand his
   surroundings.

   “You have to be quicker at adapting to the team’s tactics,” he said of
   what he learned through his first few failed loan spells. “I don’t
   think many coaches will change the tactics for you.”

   He employed that mentality when he finally did get out of his comfort
   zone with a loan to JC Roda in the Dutch second division. His 13 goals
   in 28 league matches bolstered his confidence through the 2019-20
   season, as did the 16 goals he scored in 32 matches on loan in
   Belgium’s top flight with Cercle Brugge. He now had the belief
   instilled in him from Cercle Brugge head coach (and former Chelsea
   assistant) Paul Clement of his potential as a scorer in a European top
   flight. Ugbo found himself asking more questions of Clement than he
   ever had of any previous manager to better understand how he could be
   effective.

   The conclusion of the 2020-21 season brought the end of Ugbo’s Chelsea
   contract. But for the first time in his career he had the confidence
   and agency over his career that he never did while bouncing from loan
   move to loan move. Ugbo had finally learned what qualities made him his
   most dangerous on the pitch.

   “A nuisance,” he said. “Being everywhere and being clinical. Not
   needing many chances, just one or two, to score. That’s when I’m at
   best.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ugbo’s goal-scoring put him on the radar of multiple national teams. In
   September 2021, as Ugbo was beginning to find the back of the net with
   Genk on a new permanent deal in the Belgian first division, he publicly
   stated that he would represent Nigeria. The chance to play in the 2022
   World Cup was a driving factor.

   Quietly, Ugbo still hesitated with his decision. He says now that he
   never heard from then-Nigeria national team coach Gernot Rohr
   throughout the process.

   “And,” he added, “I never grew up in Nigeria, either.”

   His first conversation with Herdman in October 2021 changed everything.

   “(Herdman) knew about me from when I was at Chelsea,” Ugbo said. “He
   knew exactly what I was going through. He spoke to me about the
   ambitions of Canada and what he’s trying to do and what he’d already
   done. Already I could see, without him telling me, the direction Canada
   was going in.”

   The Canada national team’s upward trajectory matched his own. He
   committed to Canada just before they departed for Edmonton and earned
   two crucial wins in November 2021 against Costa Rica and Mexico to go
   to the top of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying table.

   “He adapted well, right when he came on the team,” said fellow Canada
   forward Lucas Cavallini.

   This includes connecting with teammates about fashion, which he sees as
   an outlet to express his personality. During the team’s June camp in
   Vancouver, Henry took Ugbo to some of his favourite clothing spots on
   Robson Street. Henry’s guidance helped turn Ugbo on to new designers.

   But even Henry, who takes more fashion risks than his teammates, was
   taken aback.

   “Some of the things that he would wear, I would never wear,” Henry
   said, cracking a quick smile. “It’s just offside for me.”

   During the June camp, Ugbo gained enough confidence to start imparting
   some of his own personality on other teammates – for example, having
   noticed that Cavallini’s Spotify playlists relied too heavily on
   reggaeton, Ugbo grabbed Cavallini’s phone and added more American
   hip-hop to the mix in this past June’s international window.

   “He introduced me to some artists that I never used to listen to,” said
   Cavallini, “but now he’s got me hooked on them.”

   Ugbo is also making an impression on the pitch. He can use his
   instincts to quickly get inside of defenders before using his strength
   to maintain that positioning. Crucially, he can be a clinical finisher
   close to goal.

   “(Ugbo) always finds himself in the right situations,” said Canada
   teammate Jonathan David. “When his back is against the goal, he’s very
   good at holding the ball up, twisting, turning in and finding his way
   out.”

   But in a World Cup year, Ugbo’s potential is hardly as important as his
   current output. It took longer than Ugbo wanted to sign a permanent
   deal with Troyes ahead of this season, which cut into his pre-season
   and training camp. He looked sluggish, playing with a heavy touch early
   in the season. Ugbo only began to move more fluidly and find more
   scoring opportunities in September.

   Ugbo’s next step will be taking on more of a prominent role in the
   Canada team and extinguishing that outsider tag once and for all.

   “I think that can only be established through performance,” Herdman
   told The Athletic. “(He) would probably walk into another position on
   the field, but in that forward line with Jonathan David, Alphonso
   Davies, Cyle Larin, Junior Hoilett and Tajon Buchanan, that’s a tough
   group to break. So with Ike, it’s about a massive season for Troyes.”

   Still, there is a potential window of opportunity for Ugbo to make a
   mark. Cavallini occupies a similar No. 9 role as Ugbo, but with his
   Vancouver Whitecaps falling short of the MLS playoffs, Cavallini didn’t
   get regular playing time heading into the World Cup. Larin is Canada’s
   all-time leading scorer, but regular minutes at Club Brugge have been
   few and far between.

   Then there is the matter of tactical flexibility, something Herdman
   demanded of the 10 forwards he invited to Canada’s September camp.
   Could Ugbo adapt to a new role, as opposed to a typical goal-front
   poacher for Canada? Will that be the final step to him earning a start
   at the World Cup?

   Ugbo sincerely hopes so.

   “The performances in your club team, especially for me, it’s just about
   goals and assists, making sure I’m performing on a regular basis, no
   matter the team,” said Ugbo.

   He spoke in a more serious tone, before his child-like smile appeared
   again.

   After bouncing around for most of his career, ahead of the World Cup,
   he’s finally found where he can have the most important impact of his
   career to date.

   “I feel this (Canada’s national team) is where I belong.”

Martin O’Neill says he felt he was treated as an “outsider” as Ireland
manager

   November 8, 2022
   by Rudi Kinsella
   Martin O'Neill Martin O'Neill

Some fascinating comments from the former Ireland boss.

   Martin O’Neill has said that he feels as though he was treated as an
   “outsider” while he was Ireland manager.

   O’Neill managed Ireland from 2013 until 2018, helping qualify the team
   for Euro 2016, and guiding them to the round-of-16 at that tournament.
   [INS: :INS]

Martin O’Neill.

   However, despite the incredible highs of Euro ’16, there were some
   undeniable lows too, and O’Neill ultimately left his job as a divisive
   figure among Irish football fans.

   Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, O’Neill said that by the end of his
   time in charge, he was viewed in a similar light to Giovanni
   Trapattoni, in that he was seen as an outsider.

   He said that once he realised that, it didn’t matter that results were
   “okay”, and that it would be difficult to win back the fanbase.

Martin O’Neill on Ireland job

   He said: “The truth is this: there were a number of times that I was
   called ‘the Northerner’ or ‘the outsider’ and I was treated in many
   ways the same way as Trapattoni eventually became: one of those figures
   you tend to hate. I think that was it.

   “My persona didn’t seem to fit with them throughout the time,” he
   added, “and I’m even going back to heavy criticism in the early stages
   of our 2016 European campaign when we were in the same group as
   Germany, Poland, Scotland and Georgia.

   “When we only drew with Scotland in Dublin and we still had plenty of
   matches to go, the criticism was very heavy at that stage but we made
   it through.

   “I think if you are viewed as a bit of an outsider to begin with then
   it’s hard, regardless of results being okay, to win them back again.
   That would be my thoughts on it.”

   O’Neill has made his opinions on new Ireland manager Stephen Kenny very
   clear with some of the comments he has made in recent months. More on
   that here.

   Here's who is on track to win the elections for the San Jose mayor and
   Santa Clara County Sheriff races.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- The race for mayor of San Jose and Sheriff of
   Santa Clara County featured two candidates with years of experience
   working in the South Bay and two relatively new faces to the area.

   And so far, it has been those newcomers leading the results.

   Matt Mahan and Bob Jonsen took early leads in their races, touted by
   many as "outsider" candidates.

   They told us someone who has a new look at old problems in South Bay is
   exactly what voters have been looking for.

   propositions

   We spoke to Mahan today and Jonsen last week.

   "I think it's clear the voters want new leadership," Jonsen said on
   Nov. 2. "One with a fresh perspective and one that has the experience
   to deliver the reform that's necessary."

   "I think they want to hear us acknowledge that on homelessness, crime
   and affordable housing, we're moving in the wrong direction," Mahan
   said. "And, while we don't have total control over everything that
   happens in society, we need public policy to make things better."

   Mayoral candidate Cindy Chavez and sheriff Candidate Kevin Jensen both
   have years of experience working in the South Bay -- both are trailing.

   Chavez was unavailable to speak today, but told us last week there's no
   insider or outsider as she and Mahan have both worked in leadership
   roles.

   here's what's projected to pass or fail

   She recognizes that voters want change, but she said she wants it as
   well.

   "We've got to get San Jose clean if we really want to see it safer.
   That really is the only path," Chavez said on Nov. 2. "I think that
   requires a level of experience and relationships in the community that
   will allow us to move a lot of people in a better direction."

   Jensen meanwhile recognizes he is seen as the insider, but told us
   today that voters not recognizing he's been internally trying to fix
   issues attributed to former Sheriff Laurie Smith is unfair.

   "I think you're right," Jensen said. "I think the people are looking
   for change. I've been calling for change for 12 years, and it's hard to
   get people to understand the nuances of a race and not just the
   topical, 'Here's a little about each race. I'm going to make my vote.'"

   SJSU Political Science Professor Melinda Jackson told us even if the
   candidates feel they may not fit their insider or outsider mold, she
   thinks voters are making their feelings known.

   "Voters are becoming impatient and really wanting faster progress on
   these issues," Jackson said.

   The Registrar of voters is trying to process the majority of the
   ballots within the next week.

Outsider Theory

Intellectual Histories of Unorthodox Ideas

   2018
   •
   Author:

   Jonathan P. Eburne
   [mini]
   A vital and timely reminder that modern life owes as much to outlandish
   thinking as to dominant ideologies

   Outsider Theory is a timely book about outlandish ideas, bringing
   readers on an adventure in intellectual history that stresses the
   urgency of taking seriously ideas that might otherwise be regarded as
   errant, unfashionable, or even unreasonable. It shows how crucial it is
   to know how and why such ideas have left their impression on modern-day
   thinking and continue to shape its evolution.

   A bracing challenge to academic squeamishness, Outsider Theory is a
   learned, mischievous, and fascinating book that makes a compelling
   argument for the positive role of fraud, failure, and error in
   knowledge production. Outsider art, writing, and thinking can no longer
   be neatly quarantined in isolated and eccentric individuals, but must
   be recognized as thoroughly implicated in mass culture, scholarship,
   laboratory work, and critical theory.

   What do the Nag Hammadi library, Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code,
   speculative feminist historiography, Marcus Garvey’s finances, and maps
   drawn by asylum patients have in common? Jonathan P. Eburne explores
   this question as never before in Outsider Theory, a timely book about
   outlandish ideas. Eburne brings readers on an adventure in intellectual
   history that stresses the urgency of taking seriously—especially in an
   era of fake news—ideas that might otherwise be discarded or regarded as
   errant, unfashionable, or even unreasonable.



   Examining the role of such thinking in contemporary intellectual
   history, Eburne challenges the categorical demarcation of good ideas
   from flawed, wild, or bad ones, addressing the surprising extent to
   which speculative inquiry extends beyond the work of professional
   intellectuals to include that of nonprofessionals as well, whether
   amateurs, unfashionable observers, or the clinically insane.


   Considering the work of a variety of such figures—from popular occult
   writers and gnostics to so-called outsider artists and
   pseudoscientists—Eburne argues that an understanding of its circulation
   and recirculation is indispensable to the history of ideas. He devotes
   close attention to ideas and texts usually omitted from or marginalized
   within orthodox histories of literary modernism, critical theory, and
   continental philosophy, yet which have long garnered the critical
   attention of specialists in religion, science studies, critical race
   theory, and the history of the occult. In doing so he not only sheds
   new light on a fascinating body of creative thought but also proposes
   new approaches for situating contemporary humanities scholarship within
   the history of ideas.


   However important it might be to protect ourselves from “bad” ideas,
   Outsider Theory shows how crucial it is for us to know how and why such
   ideas have left their impression on modern-day thinking and continue to
   shape its evolution.

   John Wilkinson, University of Chicago

   Jonathan P. Eburne has written a generous, curious, rigorous book about
   ideas often dismissed as ridiculous, embarrassing, and even dangerous.
   Outsider Theory takes them seriously, which means subjecting them to
   the same caliber of historical analysis and philosophical critique
   usually reserved for ‘good’ ideas. In doing so, he launches us on
   several fascinating voyages across what he calls ‘the oceanic expanse
   of modern intellectual history.’
   —

   Evan Kindley, author of Poet-Critics and the Administration of Culture

   This timely book is not only genuinely interesting, but makes a strong
   and original contribution to the discussion concerning the future of
   the humanities. Jonathan P. Eburne's study of questions of method is
   itself an achievement of method, engaging with the outsiders not as a
   cabinet of curiosities, but in a way that troubles thinking, and
   especially thinking about thinking.

   outsider art, synonymous until the 1980s with art brut, any work of art
   produced by an untrained idiosyncratic artist who is typically
   unconnected to the conventional art world—not by choice but by
   circumstance. The “classic” figures of outsider art were socially or
   culturally marginal figures. They were usually undereducated; they
   almost invariably embraced unconventional views of the world, sometimes
   alien to the prevailing dominant culture; and many had been diagnosed
   as mentally ill. These people nevertheless produced—out of adversity
   and with no eye on fame or fortune—substantial high-quality artistic
   oeuvres.

Definition of terms

   Outsider art goes by many names, and the definition of terms is and has
   always been controversial. One of the most famous collections of this
   art, the Collection de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, Switz., was amassed by
   the French artist Jean Dubuffet, who is commonly regarded as a
   foundational figure.

   In the 1940s Dubuffet began collecting works of art made in unusual
   contexts. He considered these more authentic than the works of trained
   artists. In particular, he was intrigued by the art of psychiatric
   patients such as Heinrich Anton Müller, Aloïse Corbaz, and Carlo
   Zinelli; spiritualist mediums such as Augustin Lesage and Madge Gill;
   and other self-taught social isolates such as Gaston Chaissac and
   Scottie Wilson. For the art they produced, Dubuffet coined the term art
   brut (“raw” or “unrefined art”). In 1949 he wrote of his coinage:

     We understand by this term works produced by persons unscathed by
     artistic culture, where mimicry plays little or no part… These
     artists derive everything…from their own depths, and not from the
     conventions of classical or fashionable art. We are witness here to
     the completely pure artistic operation, raw, brute, and entirely
     reinvented in all of its phases solely by means of the artists’ own
     impulses.

   The term outsider art was introduced into the lexicon in 1972 by
   British writer Roger Cardinal as an English-language equivalent of the
   French art brut. By the 1980s, however, the term had expanded to
   encompass a much greater range of vernacular and “marginal” arts. This
   broadening was particularly important in the United States, where a
   rich vein of art that reflected racial, religious, and localized
   histories rather than psychiatric or spiritualist ones had grown
   independently from art brut. Known successively—and at times
   concurrently—as “popular painting,” “modern primitive art,”
   “self-taught art,” and “contemporary folk art,” works from the American
   scene were first made visible and analyzed in the 1930s by Museum of
   Modern Art (MoMA) curator and WPA Federal Art Project art director
   Holger Cahill, collector Sidney Janis, and others.

   Some of the first such American artists to be identified were Horace
   Pippin, John Kane, William Edmondson, and Morris Hirshfield. Although
   none of those artists conformed to the European idea of pathological
   artists, they were viewed in much the same way—as naïfs whose creative
   strength lay in some presumed innocence and authenticity, comparable to
   the European “Sacred Heart painters” such as Séraphine Louis and Louis
   Vivin. Later those Americans would be joined by others more closely
   conforming to Dubuffet’s “brut” definition, including Joseph Yoakum,
   Minnie Evans, Bill Traylor, James Castle, and, perhaps most famous of
   all, Henry Darger, a janitor from Chicago whose more-than-15,000-page
   illustrated novel In the Realms of the Unreal came to public notice
   only after his death. Outsider art further benefited from the addition
   at the end of the 20th century of figures such as the impressive fibre
   artist Judith Scott, who had Down syndrome and was deaf; Dwight
   Mackintosh, who was cognitively disabled and began drawing after his
   release from years of confinement in psychiatric hospitals; and Roy
   Wenzel, an autistic Dutch artist who developed a distinctive approach
   to colour and visual narrative.

History and characteristics

   Outsider art had its origins in the psychiatric collections of
   19th-century European psychiatric hospitals. The works in these
   collections were solicited from patients and organized for the purpose
   of medical teaching and analysis. About 1900 some psychiatrists and
   professional Modernist artists came to see such works not as medical
   evidence but as art. Two of the doctors produced early influential
   books on the subject: Swiss psychiatrist Walter Morgenthaler’s A Mental
   Patient as Artist (1921), which provided the first monograph of an
   outsider artist, Adolf Wölfli, a long-term patient whose oeuvre the
   Surrealist writer André Breton considered one of the three or four best
   of the 20th century; and the German psychiatrist and art historian Hans
   Prinzhorn’s Artistry of the Mentally Ill (1922), which became something
   of a touchstone for the Surrealists, especially Max Ernst, as well as
   for Dubuffet and subsequently many others.

   The artists Dubuffet chose to put in his category of art brut were
   socially marginalized—often denied not only their liberty but also
   their status as adults. Nevertheless, even the most distant of them—who
   were autistic or resided in other realities—did not create art out of
   nothing. For example, Wölfli and the Mexican artist Martín Ramírez, who
   had been held up as paragons of uninfluenced creativity, in fact had
   deep connections with culture outside the psychiatric hospital, both
   before and after their confinement, that were formative in their
   artwork and important aspects of its content. For other outsider
   artists, such as Howard Finster or Bill Traylor, it has long been
   agreed that content and context were uppermost in their work.
   Typically, the visual image was primarily a vehicle for the
   proselytizing and storytelling impulse of the artist.

   One of the threads connecting the groups within the outsider art
   category is the tendency of the artists to be “straight talking” (even
   if that talk is straight from a radically different worldview).
   Outsider art used to be seen as a kind of evolutionary prototype for
   much of Modernist practice, but, considered by itself, it was valued
   for its essential difference from that practice. By the early 2000s the
   work of outsiders could often look like an awkward version of what
   Dubuffet scathingly called the “usual art”—that is, the accepted and
   acceptable production of the contemporary mainstream. The confusion was
   more likely to result from “outsiderish” trends among trained artists
   than from any wish of outsiders to conform. Because outsider art tends
   to concern itself primarily with its message, the works often seemed
   more readily accessible and visually coherent to viewers than did those
   of the mainstream artists whose spaces it had begun to invade.

   While the Surrealists, according to their general practice of
   transgressing cultural boundaries, tended to show outsider art in the
   company of their own work, exhibitions of outsider art were otherwise
   restricted to specialist galleries and museums, such as the Collection
   de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, Switz.; the Aracine Musée d’Art Brut (Gagny)
   and the Musée de la Création Franche (Bègles) in France; and, in the
   United States, the American Folk Art Museum and the Galerie St.
   Etienne, both in New York City, and the Phyllis Kind Gallery in
   Chicago. Occasional outsider art exhibitions in mainstream galleries,
   such as Dubuffet’s 1967 "Art Brut" at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in
   Paris or the 1979 "Outsiders: An Art Without Precedence or Tradition"
   at the Hayward Gallery in London, only served to reinforce the sense of
   separation from the contemporary mainstream.

   A much-discussed exhibition of 2007 at the American Folk Art Museum and
   subsequently at the Milwaukee (Wis.) Art Museum showcased the work of
   Martín Ramírez (1895–1963), who worked entirely within the confines of
   the California psychiatric hospital where he was a patient for the
   greater part of his adult life. Though long known among those
   interested in outsider art, his works were thus introduced to a much
   wider U.S. audience. The New York Times described the exhibit as “one
   of the best shows of the season” and went so far as to declare Ramírez
   “one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.”

   The showing of Ramírez’s work confirmed a general move since the
   mid-1990s toward the wider acceptance of outsider art into mainstream
   galleries and museums and a recognition of its worthiness for serious
   art-world attention on its own terms. Other notable examples include
   exhibitions in 2005 at Kiasma, Helsinki’s museum of contemporary art,
   and at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. On the whole,
   however, outsider art continued to circulate among an international
   spread of specialist dealers, collectors, and galleries, and an annual
   New York Outsider Art Fair was established in 1992, attracting dealers
   from the United States, Europe, and Asia.

   A landmark exhibition of outsider, or “vernacular,” environments,
   “Sublime Spaces and Visionary Worlds,” was held in 2007–08 at the John
   Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wis. Such environments are an
   important part of the range of outsider art. Often significant in size
   and invariably the result of the compulsive vision and tireless work of
   a single individual (though occasionally helped by others later on),
   they can be found the world over. The best-known early example is
   Ferdinand Cheval’s Ideal Palace (built 1879–1912) in Hauterives,
   France. Other important environments include Sabato (Simon) Rodia’s
   Watts Towers in Los Angeles, Calif., Fred Smith’s Wisconsin Concrete
   Park in Phillips, Wis., Veijo Rönkkönen’s Sculpture Park in Parikkala,
   Finland, and Nek Chand’s Rock Garden in Chandigarh, India.

Can this ‘art world outsider’ draw in an art-curious YouTube crowd?

Hosted by a science writer and actor, the Getty’s "Becoming Artsy" video
series ditches the traditional documentary delivery of art history in favour
of emotion, drama and fun

   “Hi, I’m Jessie. I’m a sciencey math kind of person, and yet, I work at
   the Getty—famous for its art and culture.” So begins each ten-minute
   episode of the J. Paul Getty Trust’s light-hearted YouTube video series
   Becoming Artsy.

   The initiative was launched a year ago as an introduction to the Los
   Angeles-based organisation’s museum, research institute and gardens. In
   its newly released second series, it has morphed into a programme that
   promotes learning about art through the lenses of science and history,
   with recent episodes including topics such as jousting and human
   anatomy.

   The goal is to make the Getty (and the art world in general) less
   intimidating for people who do not know much about art but are curious
   to learn. As a science writer and actor with little knowledge of art
   history, Jessie Hendricks, the series host, is “becoming artsy” along
   with her audience.

   The series is the brainchild of Christopher Sprinkle, the lead creative
   producer at the Getty, who had grown increasingly frustrated with
   making YouTube explainers alongside the Getty’s curators and staff.
   While being extremely knowledgeable, his expert interviewees were often
   not comfortable in front of the camera. “It was like pulling teeth
   trying to get emotion and drama out of them,” Sprinkle says.

   That is how he got the idea of hiring a host who could “lighten the air
   and ask questions in a way that people without a background in art
   history could relate to”. Hendricks says: “They wanted a host not
   afraid to ask the simple questions, like, who’s Ed Ruscha? I did ask
   that question.”

   80&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;auto=format]

   Hands on: some of the highlights from season two of Becoming Artsy
   include (clockwise from top left) making ultramarine blue from lapis
   lazuli, zooming in on medieval calligraphy, the shieldwork physics of
   jousting, and working out what the past actually looked like Courtesy
   of J. Paul Getty Museum

   Hendricks is not only the host of the series but also the writer,
   producer and—most of the time—cameraperson. (She calls herself a
   “one-man-band content creator”.) She and Sprinkle work together on the
   series, but after the first couple of introductory episodes, he gave
   her free rein to explore any topic she wanted, wrangling curators and
   asking fellow staff members for suggestions in the process. “I’ve been
   fortunate to craft the episodes to my interests and follow my
   instincts,” she says. Both she and Sprinkle are particularly
   enthusiastic about a recent episode in which she and Getty staff make
   ultramarine pigment from scratch, just as artists did during the
   Renaissance.

   Becoming Artsy is an unusual YouTube series for an art museum, and not
   just because it is hosted by an art outsider. While other museum videos
   focus on specific works in their collections and film using what
   Sprinkle calls a “traditional documentary style”, the Getty’s series is
   more hands-on. In an episode on jousting, for instance, Hendricks and
   Larisa Grollemond, a curator in the manuscripts department, drive more
   than an hour north of LA to take a jousting class together while
   discussing the history of the sport and its depiction in Medieval
   manuscripts.

   When asked which videos inspired the feel of Becoming Artsy, Hendricks
   and Sprinkle cite history and science series more than those about art.
   Hendricks is a fan of Physics Girl, Raven the Science Maven, and The
   Brain Scoop from the Field Museum in Chicago. They both mention the
   explainers from the US media company Vox as some of their favourite
   videos.

     They wanted a host not afraid to ask the simple questions, like
     who’s Ed Ruscha? I did ask that question

   Jessie Hendricks, YouTube series host

   Sprinkle says in his original pitch for Becoming Artsy, he used the
   example of a 2017 video on Stonehenge by Vox producer Joss Fong, in
   which she explains the history and significance of the prehistoric
   monument while making a scale model of it on her living room floor. He
   liked how “anti-stock footage” and “conversational” it felt. In the
   first episode of Becoming Artsy, Hendricks sits on the floor of her
   porch and tiles a surface while talking about the Getty Villa.

   It is clear from the videos that the Getty staff are having a great
   time and, although some moments come off as twee, it is all part of the
   appeal. “We want to counter the impression that the Getty is an elitist
   organisation,” says Sprinkle. “I want us to make content that both my
   mum and my daughter would want to watch.”

   Casting a wide net is the reason behind hosting a video series on
   YouTube in the first place. “It’s the largest searched site on the
   internet after Google, and an incredible way to reach audiences around
   the world,” Sprinkle points out.

   According to Hendricks, Becoming Artsy has been viewed in more than 50
   countries, with the two main audiences being the US and the UK. The
   first episode, released on 5 October 2021, currently has the most views
   —almost 10,000. One titled A Beginner’s Guide to Appreciating Art comes
   in second with more than 7,000 views. “The priority is to attract new
   audiences, those who might be art-curious,” Hendricks says. And not
   just to the Getty, but to any art museum in the world.

About

   While many artists throughout the history of art have received formal
   training in art practice and making, this is by no means the case for
   all artists. For various reasons, including lack of access due to race,
   class, and/or gender, in addition to factors such as physical, mental,
   and developmental disabilities as well as cultural norms, numerous
   artists have established art practices without a formal art education.
   While much has been written about the so-called “naïveté” and
   child-like spontaneity of self-taught, folk, and Outsider artists, a
   new wave of scholarship is emerging that sheds light on these artist’s
   innovations, mastery, and contributions to art history.

Matt Rhule named as lively outsider for open college coaching vacancy

   Carolina Panthers head coach Matt Rhule has been named as a lively
   outside for a recently opened college football coaching vacancy.

   Until Matt Rhule turns the Carolina Panthers around, his name will
   either be in the firing line or linked with college vacancies.

   The former Baylor man might have a strong reputation for building
   programs back to relevancy. But this hasn’t translated to an NFL
   franchise yet and something that has many projecting his name to be the
   first removed in the ever-changing coaching cycle.

   Based on what’s transpired since Rhule took over from Ron Rivera in
   2020, he might be better suited to the collegiate ranks. The NFL isn’t
   for anybody, with many failing to make the jump before David Tepper
   shelled out $62 million to keep his guy out of the New York Giants’
   grasp.

   Rhule remains defiant despite Carolina’s complete lack of form. One win
   in 10 games and 24 straight defeats when an opposing team scores more
   than 17 points is a damning indictment of his ability to adjust and the
   constant change of quarterbacks hasn’t done him any favors, either.

Matt Rhule named as lively outside for vacant Wisconsin job

   When asked about his job status following the Panthers’ loss against
   the Arizona Cardinals, Rhule didn’t indicate anything had changed
   regarding Tepper’s unwavering support. However, the tipping point might
   not be too much further away given the tough stretch of games upcoming
   for the Panthers, which means things could get even worse in the coming
   weeks.

   The head coach didn’t disclose whether or not he had received offers to
   return to college. Rhule knows the job is far from finished in
   Carolina, but there could come a time when he needs to start thinking
   about reputation self-preservation in the wake of some glaring media
   criticism.

   One recent opening sees Wisconsin looking for a new man at the helm
   after parting ways with Paul Chryst. Although Rhule doesn’t appear
   willing to leave the Panthers right now, that hasn’t stopped him from
   being named as a lively outsider for the role.

   The recent odds on who’ll replace Chryst on bookies.com has Rhule at
   +3000 to take over at the Badgers. This places him as the eighth
   favorite to secure the job, meaning it’s unlikely but not entirely out
   of the question.

   Whether this is something Tepper is waiting for is also something to
   consider. Giving up a substantial sum to end this experiment short
   would likely sting, so waiting around for a college program to pick up
   the tab instead seems like a win-win for the billionaire.

   That probably won’t help Carolina’s chances of immediate progression.
   Rhule might also be waiting around for a more prominent school to call
   in pursuit of salvaging his reputation.

   Rhule seems likable. Even if he appears in way over his head at the
   next level.

   The same tendencies that brought Baylor and Temple back to prominence
   haven’t rubbed off positively on grown men at the peak of their powers.
   But everyone does appear to be pulling in the same direction despite
   having little to celebrate over the last three years.

   Frustrations are also growing to a breaking point within the fanbase,
   which has the scope to impact Tepper’s bottom line. If Rhule went to
   the college ranks without being pushed, then this would arguably solve
   a lot of problems for everyone involved if things continue trending on
   a downward curve.

‘Panicked’ Truss abandons plan to hire outsider to shake-up Treasury

   British PM picks Treasury veteran James Bowler in last minute U-turn,
   even after Antonia Romeo was offered the job.

   Prime Minister Liz Truss has ditched her plan to hire a dynamic senior
   official to shake-up the Treasury and lead a sweeping overhaul of U.K.
   economic policy, in a sign that a crisis of confidence has gripped her
   faltering, month-old administration.

   In what insiders said was a panic move, Truss at the weekend overruled
   her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng over the appointment of the new chief
   official in the Treasury, a vital decision amid mounting unease over
   the government’s handling of the economy.

   As soon as they took office last month, Truss and Kwarteng fired the
   long-serving permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Tom Scholar,
   apparently wanting fresh leadership at the top of Whitehall’s most
   powerful department.

   Kwarteng and Truss had been preparing to name Antonia Romeo — the
   highest profile business-facing official in government — as Scholar’s
   replacement. Her mission was to have been to drive through an overhaul
   of what Truss’s team had disapprovingly called “Treasury orthodoxy” in
   order to deliver rapid growth.

   Kwarteng and his team had even privately named Romeo as his first
   choice for the role, with Truss’ apparent agreement. But the embattled
   prime minister, reeling from a succession of self-inflicted crises,
   backtracked on the plan and appointed James Bowler, a former Treasury
   insider, instead.

   People familiar with the process said Truss “panicked” over the
   appointment after the government’s tax-cutting mini-budget bombed,
   triggering a massive selloff in the currency and bond markets.

   The people said Romeo had been offered and had accepted the role last
   week. Transition arrangements in preparation for her arrival at the
   Treasury were already under way before the prime minister’s
   U-turn, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing
   confidential matters.

   The chaotic process risks further undermining Truss’ reputation for
   competence and eroding the government’s already damaged credibility on
   its handling of the economy. It also leaves open huge questions over
   what happens to Truss’ personal pledge to deliver “growth, growth,
   growth” .

   Truss and Kwarteng’s decision to push Scholar out last month provoked
   dismay from senior figures in Westminster and Whitehall, including
   former chancellors and two ex-cabinet secretaries.

   They might have got away with it had their first fiscal announcements
   not been a disaster. The Bank of England had to intervene to stabilise
   the market turmoil, pledging to buy up government debt in order to stem
   spiralling borrowing costs.

   Last week, amid a growing political backlash from within the ruling
   Conservative party, Truss decided to reverse Kwarteng’s plan to cut the
   45p top rate of income tax for the highest earners.

   Her decision to overrule him again will raise further doubts about the
   status of their working relationship. Asked repeatedly by broadcasters
   last week whether she trusted her chancellor in the wake of the budget
   chaos, Truss refused to say that she did.

   After news broke Monday of Bowler’s appointment, No. 10
   officials insisted the decision was taken jointly by the PM and
   chancellor. While Truss rates Romeo highly, Bowler was judged to be the
   best person for the job given his Treasury background, according
   to government aides.

   The PM’s spokesman denied that the government was in chaos after the
   mini-budget, adding that Truss was “confident” in the measures she has
   announced to boost growth and support people through winter.

   Both Romeo, who runs the Ministry of Justice, and Bowler, who is the
   top official at the Department for International Trade, were well
   qualified for the position, as long-standing civil servants with
   experience running government departments.

   Some media reports suggested Romeo would not have been universally
   welcomed in the Treasury because she was seen as a disruptor. However,
   one senior Whitehall official said Romeo would have brought more drive
   and commercial experience than Bowler to the role. She has worked as a
   diplomat drumming up business for the U.K. in New York and set up the
   Department for International Trade, running it as permanent secretary
   for four years before Bowler took over last year.

   "It's a shame. Antonia would have brought a lot of energy, great drive
   and leadership, with a more commercial perspective," the official said.
   "James is a good guy, very sensible" and is embedded in "classic
   Treasury orthodoxy" due to his long career in the economic department,
   the official said. Bowler's record at the Treasury stretches back to
   2005, when he was principal private secretary to Labour's chancellor at
   the time, Gordon Brown.

   "Something strange seems to have happened. She was appointed and then
   not," said the senior official, who asked not to be named because they
   were not authorized to speak publicly. "Whether it's panic or not I
   don't know."

   In the official announcement, Kwarteng said he was “delighted to
   welcome James back to the Treasury.”

   The recruitment process was led by Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary,
   the country’s most senior, politically impartial official who is in
   charge of the civil service. Officially, he made the appointment, with
   the approval of Truss and the agreement of Kwarteng, according to the
   government’s press release.

   This article has been updated with more details, including the
   government statement confirming the announcement.

Prince Harry treated as 'outsider' by King Charles

Prince Harry's UK trip has "awakened some misery in him"

   By Web Desk
   October 09, 2022
   Prince Harry treated as outsider by King Charles

   Prince Harry's recent visit to the UK has "awakened some misery in
   him", a biographer has claimed.

   Tom Bower, the author of royal book Revenge, claimed that the Duke of
   Sussex was an "outsider" and "so cut off" from family at the Queen's
   funeral.

   Harry was not allowed to wear his military uniform at the funeral, and
   the Duke and his wife Meghan were reportedly not invited to attend the
   state reception hosted at Buckingham Palace.

   "I think the funeral awakened some misery in him that he was so cut off
   from his family and friends and was an outsider," Bower told Page Six.

   According to the expert, Harry returned to the US with some bad
   memories and was not happy with the treatment of his royal relatives
   during the Queen's funeral.

Meet The Anti-Corruption Outsider Who Could Be Nigeria’s Next President

Peter Obi, a man who carries his own suitcases, could be Nigeria’s next
president, The Economist reports.

   An interview with an outsider who says he will actually do something
   about corruption.

   “This is a case of Goliath and David,” says Peter Obi, a long-shot
   candidate who has unexpectedly taken the lead in the race to become
   president of Africa’s most populous country and its biggest economy.
   “The big people are there, but allow this small person to do it. And I
   know I can do it.”

   As public campaigning was about to begin in late September, Nigeria was
   rocked by the release of three polls showing Mr Obi well ahead of the
   two candidates representing the main parties that have mis-ruled
   Nigeria since the restoration of its democracy in 1999. In two of the
   polls Mr Obi has a lead of more than 15 percentage points over Bola
   Tinubu, of the incumbent All Progressives Congress (apc), and Atiku
   Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (pdp), the main opposition.
   What makes this even more extraordinary is that Mr Obi is standing for
   the Labour Party, whose candidate at the previous presidential election
   in 2019 won just 5,074 votes out of 28m cast.

   Mr Obi’s sudden ascent represents a rare chance for Nigeria. The
   country ought to be rich: it has huge reserves of oil, gas and other
   minerals, plenty of fertile land and a young population of go-getters.
   Yet Nigerians are poorer today than they were ten years ago and 40% of
   them survive on less than $1.90 a day.

   The reasons why Nigeria is poor are rotten politics, bad governance and
   corruption. Politicians in Nigeria have long stirred up ethnic and
   religious divisions by promising to direct state resources to members
   of their own group. Once in power they have pursued contorted economic
   policies such as a fixed exchange rate and massive fuel subsidies. Some
   policies seem to make sense only as a way of allowing cronies to siphon
   off cash.

   Neither of the two main candidates contesting the presidential election
   scheduled for February offers much hope for change. Mr Abubakar, a
   former customs official turned tycoon, was accused alongside his wife
   in 2010 by a US Senate committee report of being linked to the transfer
   of $40m in “suspect funds” to America. (He denies wrongdoing.) Mr
   Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state, had his assets frozen in the
   1990s by the American government, which alleged it had probable cause
   to believe the money was linked to drugs. Mr Tinubu, who has also
   denied wrongdoing, reached a settlement with the American government
   whereby he agreed to forfeit $460,000.

   There are, of course, no guarantees that Mr Obi would break the
   kleptocracy that is throttling Nigeria: the country’s political system
   has a habit of corrupting even those who start out with the best of
   intentions. But if he were to sustain his lead until the election in
   February, he would be the first politician in decades to show that a
   new sort of politics is possible in Nigeria. If he is able to keep
   energising young, urban voters across the country’s main divides of
   religion, geography and ethnicity, he may well redraw Nigeria’s
   electoral map. And by making this election about competence, character
   and perhaps even ideas, Mr Obi promises to upend the old electoral
   calculus, which was based on horse-trading to form majorities between
   politicians who gathered votes mainly among their coreligionists or
   ethnic groups.

   In many ways, Mr Obi seems an unlikely revolutionary. He is rich, like
   many of Nigeria’s political elite. (Unlike many other wealthy Nigerian
   politicians, Mr Obi seems to have made his money before taking office
   or working for the government.) He is also no political outsider,
   having served two terms as governor of Anambra state until 2014 and
   then standing as Mr Abubakar’s vice-presidential candidate in 2019.

   Here the similarities end. As an energetic 61-year-old Mr Obi stands in
   sharp contrast to the 75-year-old Mr Abubakar and to Mr Tinubu, who
   though just a decade older was recently forced to respond to widespread
   rumours of ill health by posting a video of himself pedalling an
   exercise bicycle on Twitter, saying: “Many have said I have died;
   others claim I have withdrawn from the presidential campaign. Well…
   Nope.” Mr Obi, on the other hand, has a vigorous social-media operation
   with a vast, passionate following, and is strikingly open to
   interviews.

   Mr Obi’s surging popularity is due, above all, to perceptions of his
   character. In a country cursed by politicians of extraordinary ego and
   entourage, his supporters marvel that as governor Mr Obi queued at
   airports holding his own luggage. He also slashed the size of his
   motorcade when he found that 13 of the cars were empty, he says. This
   not only plays well with young voters, but also annoys his rivals.
   Kashim Shettima, Mr Tinubu’s running-mate, grumbles that Mr Obi “tends
   to glamorise poverty” by claiming to own only one watch. (Mr Shettima,
   who likes smart watches, says he “has more than two or three”.)

   Frugality is relative in Nigerian politics. The Economist interviewed
   Mr Obi in his suite in the most plush hotel in Abuja, the capital (it
   is also one of the most secure), though at least Mr Obi was free of the
   hordes of hangers-on who typically surround Nigerian bigwigs. His
   running-mate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, is also far from poor.

   When asked what distinguishes him most from the other two major
   candidates Mr Obi replies: “Who can people trust?” He promises to
   deliver and not to steal. Yet he too has faced some questions over his
   financial affairs. The Pandora Papers, a large set of leaks to the
   press of records from financial companies, revealed that Mr Obi owned
   an undeclared offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, a tax
   haven. He also reportedly failed to declare all his assets or
   immediately relinquish control of all his companies, as required by the
   law, upon becoming governor. Mr Obi claimed at the time that he did not
   know he had to declare assets held jointly with his family and that he
   did relinquish control of the company in question, but that an error
   meant it was not enacted for 14 months.

   To try to show that the money in those companies was earned before he
   entered politics, Mr Obi pulls out stacks of letters from his bank in
   London showing the scale of his lines of business credit in the 1990s.
   In any case, he argues, his rivals are very rich, too. “What is their
   source of wealth?” he asks. Context matters. “Relative to the field…he
   is a saint, more or less,” says Ebenezer Obadare of the Council on
   Foreign Relations, a think-tank New York. Though that does not
   necessarily make him “clean”, he adds.

   Mr Obi also wants to run on competence. He emphasises that he left a
   fiscal surplus to his successor as governor⁠—a rarity. Anambra’s score
   on the Human Development Index, a measure of income, education and life
   expectancy, was falling when Mr Obi entered office in 2006. It bottomed
   out by 2008, with Anambra ranked eighth among Nigeria’s states. By the
   time he left office in 2014, Anambra had leapt to third place, trailing
   only the capital and Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. Between 2006
   and 2012, Onitsha, the biggest city in the state, was in the top 50 of
   750 cities worldwide for the rate of private-sector job growth,
   according to the World Bank.

   Mr Obi is disappointingly less keen to emphasise his proposed policies
   as president. “We’re all going to come up with the same products but
   which of these brands will you trust?” he says. Still, improving
   security is his “number one priority”. It ought to be. Over the past
   eight years under President Muhammadu Buhari, jihadist terrorists have
   terrorised Nigeria’s north-east. Violence in the south-east, often
   attributed to Igbo separatists, has surged, as has crime. Gangs known
   locally as bandits killed 2,600 people last year.

   To restore order Mr Obi promises to expand the security forces and
   equip them better. Structurally he proposes giving states and local
   governments the power to have their own police officers, rather than
   rely solely on federal forces. He is also willing to talk to armed
   groups that have political demands such as the Indigenous People of
   Biafra, a separatist group in his own south-eastern region.

   When it comes to the economy, his instincts appear liberal. “There is a
   lot of government involved where the private sector should be,” he
   says. Nigeria’s petrol subsidies will eat up more than federal spending
   on health, education and welfare combined. Mr Obi promises to get rid
   of these handouts: “Fifty per cent of it is corruption, you deal with
   it immediately.” The rest could take three or six months, he says. Yet
   the Labour Party has close ties with unions, many of which have
   repeatedly opposed subsidy reform. “I’m not going to make promises I’m
   not going to fulfil,” he insists. When it comes to the currency Mr
   Obi’s liberalism wears thin. He is not in favour of letting the naira
   float freely, though he says he would allow the official rate to move
   closer to the black-market one.

   Frugality also shapes his attitude to debt. “We want to borrow strictly
   for investment, if need be—if at all!” he says, criticising Nigeria’s
   rising debts to China. Yet thrift alone is unlikely to solve Nigeria’s
   problems. Federal government spending is just 6% of gdp. Even with more
   efficient spending, there will not be enough cash to tackle Nigeria’s
   enormous infrastructure needs. Increasing Nigeria’s paltry tax take is
   crucial, but goes largely unmentioned by Mr Obi.

   Can Mr Obi pull it off? His supporters think so. “I am an Obi-dient
   man,” laughs Kingsley Onwe, a trader selling tomato paste at a street
   market outside Abuja. Mr Onwe is not advertising general deference to
   authority. “Obi-dients” is the nickname for Mr Obi’s supporters. His
   rivals are, however, dismissive. “We’re not bothered about him,” says
   Dino Melaye, Mr Abubakar’s campaign spokesman. The vituperative attack
   that the former senator launches suggests otherwise. In his telling, Mr
   Obi is a “deceptive character” who has a “plethora of allegations
   against him”. For good measure he adds that Mr Obi “knows himself that
   he cannot win it but he sees it as an avenue to make money.” Should
   your correspondent want to talk more about running for office to make
   money, Mr Melaye (who enjoys posing with his collection of Ferraris and
   Lamborghinis) leaves his business card: a metallic-gold one that looks
   like a credit card.

   Even if the polls are accurate—the large share of undecided voters
   suggests the outcome is still in flux—Mr Obi will still have to clear
   several hurdles on the path to becoming president. The first relates to
   the rules. In order to avoid a run-off, the winning candidate must not
   only have the most votes. They must also get more than 25% in each of
   at least two-thirds of the country’s 36 states and capital territory.
   Doing so, admits Mr Baba-Ahmed, may be challenging, particularly in ten
   northern states that have tended to swing for northern and Muslim
   candidates whereas Mr Obi is a Christian from the south.

   Mr Shettima, the ruling party’s vice-presidential candidate, is also
   dismissive of Mr Obi’s chances in the north. The former governor of the
   northern state of Borno, suggests asking northerners about Mr Obi,
   saying they will think “he is either a musician or a footballer”. From
   doing just that it is clear that Mr Shettima is exaggerating. On the
   streets of Kano, the biggest city in the north, enormous billboards of
   Mr Tinubu and Mr Abubakar loom large. Mr Obi’s image is all but absent
   and at his Kano headquarters a broken billboard was leaning against a
   fence. No one but a toothy guard was present. Despite this, some polls
   show him running second in the north.

   Even so, Kano illustrates a second risk to Mr Obi’s campaign. The
   Labour Party he represents will not have candidates on dozens of
   ballots for seats in the Senate and 130 seats in the House of
   Representatives. This means it will have to convince voters to break
   with habit and cast their votes “skirt and blouse” (backing one party
   for president and another for the other races). Moreover, the party has
   few members, no state governors and just one senator. Usually governors
   and senators help funnel cash (both legitimately donated and less so)
   to campaigns and rustle up the tens of thousands of party lackeys who
   go out to persuade, bully or bribe people to vote for their parties
   candidate.

   Mr Melaye of the PDP explains with disarming frankness why these
   structures matter. “In every catchment area you have people who are the
   owners of the voters,” he says, without blushing. Mr Baba-Ahmed gamely
   puts a brave face on the Labour Party’s weakness, saying that it will
   allow him and Mr Obi to govern cleanly because they will not be
   beholden to bigwigs. That may be so, but they have to win first.

   In a bid to do so, Mr Obi is trying to tackle vote-buying head on. “I
   tell people every day, the money people are sharing is just stolen
   money, it is not their money,” he says, “That’s why people are dying in
   hospitals. That’s why there are no roads.” This election will be a test
   of whether the old way of doing politics has been superseded by one
   based on individual choice and direct appeals to the public.

   The third risk to Mr Obi’s campaign is outright rigging. Mr Obi himself
   plays down such fears. Recent reforms to the vote-counting process
   should make ballot-stuffing harder this time. Yet Mr Baba-Ahmed is “not
   confident” the vote will be free and fair. Some activists share these
   concerns. Ayisha Osori of the Open Society Foundations, an advocacy and
   philanthropy group, thinks the ruling apc will try to depress turnout
   in areas where Mr Obi is strong. Doing so could spark conflict. “If
   they decide to humiliate [Obi] and have a blatantly rigged, violent
   election, I’m really worried about what people will do,” she says. Mr
   Obi himself brushes off the idea his supporters might react angrily to
   a defeat. He is simply focused on winning. “I’m saying I’m better, I’m
   saying I can do it better,” he insists. “Trust me.” Right now at least,
   many do.
