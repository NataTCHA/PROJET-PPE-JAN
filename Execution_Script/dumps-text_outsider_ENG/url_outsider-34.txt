   The total percentage of faculty and academic staff of color at Michigan
   State University is 28.9%. For faculty members like public affairs
   professor Ramya Swayamprakash, the lack of diversity can be isolating.

   “It’s just (a) constant feeling of being an outsider, having to prove
   that I belong here,” Swayamprakash said. “And it oftentimes leads to an
   imposter syndrome, which is really hard to sort of break out (of). I
   don’t think a lot of my white colleagues have to ever think or engage
   in those sorts of thoughts on an everyday, existential level.”

   Swayamprakash said being a woman of color disadvantages her on a
   regular basis, particularly with colleagues casting doubt on her
   abilities.

   “(My white colleagues) question my native tongue, which is English,”
   Swayamprakash said. “Because I’m a minority, I don’t speak ‘American.’
   … These kinds of things, especially in the work environment, can be
   detrimental to anybody, because then other people begin to see you as
   not so capable because you don’t speak the right way.” ﻿

   International relations professor Robert Brathwaite is Vietnamese and
   Black. He said this phenomenon happens to students of color as well and
   can lead to feeling inadequate. He feels like he can't make any
   mistakes and having a multiracial background can perpetuate the feeling
   of estrangement from his white counterparts.

   Comparative culture and politics professor Sejuti Das Gupta, who is
   Indian, said she feels pressured to validate or prove her knowledge.

   “I had to learn I was competing with my white colleagues that probably
   have been a part of the system for a much longer time,” Das Gupta said.
   “That was definitely a disadvantage for me. Initially, for two years, I
   put in extra hours of work.”

   Das Gupta said an especially challenging moment of pushback was when
   students found her accent hard to understand, which she didn't know how
   to control. An accent, she said, is how a minority speaks a language.

   Spanish and cultural studies professor Claudia Berrios-Campos is
   Peruvian and Latina. She said stereotypes associated with different
   racial and ethnic backgrounds can permeate her relationships with
   students. Often, she said, others are surprised by her education. ﻿

   “(They’re) really impressed that I even managed to get a degree,”
   Berrios-Campus said. “They assumed by default that I didn’t have access
   to great education, but I am fortunate to say that I did. It’s not the
   same story for a lot of Peruvians, but I had a very good and diverse
   education.” ﻿

   Berrios-Campos also said she noticed a difference in the way her
   students receive her expertise as a woman of color. When she gave
   comments about the role of U.S. colonial structures in her Latino
   American literature class, she said she received "attitude" from
   students. ﻿

   "Almost like, ‘Who are you to talk about American politics?’"
   Berrios-Campos said. "I’m a professor!”

   Swayamprakash has experienced difficulty trying to connect with her
   students as well, as a direct result of her race.

   “I do think there is a fair degree of resistance to somebody who
   doesn’t speak like Americans, and I don’t think it’s malicious,”
   Swayamprakash said. “I think it’s just creatures of habit. Having
   somebody new who doesn’t look like, speak like you can be challenging.
   I've had my fair share of students who don’t like my face because of
   the way I talk, because I’m Indian.”

Lack of diversity in James Madison College presents challenges for students

   Swayamprakash said students frequently assumed she studied a STEM
   subject rather than social science. Assumptions like these feed into
   the notion that humanities are less relevant than sciences,
   Barrios-Campos said.

   “The lack of seriousness is perceived,” Swayamprakash said. “The
   humanities have certain stigma on not being considered true
   contributions in the development of humanity. This always makes me very
   sad and a little angry.” ﻿

   Barrios-Campos said while subjects like biology, finance and medicine
   are essential facets of human progress, the humanities provide an extra
   element of future implications. These nuanced contributions, she said,
   have become increasingly important in the face of historical events
   like the pandemic, which has affected human contact.  ﻿

   “With sciences versus social sciences, there is a definite difference
   of acceptance,” Das Gupta said. “The other thing that I’ve experienced
   is … I was very passionate about doing field work. But when I would
   tell that to students … they made the decision that I chose that path
   because I was not good at philosophy or theory.” ﻿

   Even within social sciences, Das Gupta said, there is an assumed
   hierarchy: scholars that study theory are considered serious, while
   those that do field work can be perceived as less accomplished
   academically.

   The preconceptions surrounding minorities in humanities also affect
   academic endeavors beyond the classroom. Brathwaite said making
   professional connections can be difficult.

   For professors of color, networks may look different than that of their
   white colleagues. However, Brathwaite said, this is not necessarily a
   reflection of their competence, but rather the institutional structure
   that limits minorities’ access.﻿

   Das Gupta said there are a number of grants that professors cannot
   apply for if they are not citizens – which is a significant
   disadvantage for many minorities.

   “If you want to retain a diverse group of faculty, we need to think
   about, ‘How do we enable them to do that kind of work?’” Das Gupta
   said. “I don't think in this situation, having equal funding makes it
   equal. I think it needs to have an equal outcome.”

   In the midst of these issues, Brathwaite said, an arc of progress can
   be seen within academia.﻿

   “It seems like we’re moving beyond the conversation towards people
   understanding actions need to be taken," Brathwaite said. "Now, that
   still means these things need to be implemented. I think there’s a lot
   of work that still needs to happen.” ﻿
