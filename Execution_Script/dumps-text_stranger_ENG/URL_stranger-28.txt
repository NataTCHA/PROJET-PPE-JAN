   Cecily Harrington off her feet. Little does she know the ghastly truth
   about her new beau…

More about this story

   Cecily Harrington has led a staid and proper existence. After winning a
   large amount of money in a sweepstake she desperately yearns for a life
   of adventure. Enter Bruce Lovell, a handsome and charming stranger who
   sweeps her off her feet. In a whirlwind romance, she recklessly
   abandons her job, friends and fiancé to settle in the remote and
   blissful surroundings of a country cottage. However, her newfound “love
   from a stranger” is not what it seems and in an astonishingly tense
   final scene, Cecily discovers the ghastly truth of her new love.

   An intense and chilling psychological thriller which examines the
   sadistic mind of a serial killer and the extremes to which the power of
   suggestion can be pushed.

   A brilliant terror play … our blood was gloriously curdled.

     The Daily Herald

   Love From a Stranger is an adaptation by Agatha Christie and Frank
   Vosper which draws both on Christie's earlier play, The Stranger, and
   her short story, Philomel Cottage. Some years before this play,
   Christie herself wrote a stage version, calling it The Stranger. Love
   from a Stranger opened at the New Theatre (now Noël Coward) in the West
   End in 1936. It was then reworked for film a year later, starring Ann
   Harding and Basil Rathbone. The play was then televised in 1938, live
   on BBC Television. When the story was adapted for the American
   half-hour radio programme Suspense it starred Orson Welles as Gerald.
   2018 welcomes a new UK tour of Love From a Stranger. Find out more.
