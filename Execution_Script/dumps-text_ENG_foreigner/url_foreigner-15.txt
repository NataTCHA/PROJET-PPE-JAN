   (May 2012) Improving the Measurement of Cross-Border Securities
   Holdings: The Treasury International Capital SLT (PDF). In the wake of
   the financial crisis, growing interest in improving the measurement of
   cross-border securities positions spurred the introduction of a new
   Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting form, the TIC SLT. This
   article reviews the existing structure of TIC cross-border position and
   flow data, the benefits that the new SLT can provide, and the incoming
   information from the first two reporting months of SLT data, September
   and December 2011. While some patterns and characteristics of the SLT
   data will become clear only after more data have accumulated, the SLT
   data have already begun to provide timely insights on U.S. and foreign
   cross-border investment flows that are different from the monthly
   estimates provided by existing flow data. It is from the Federal
   Reserve Bulletin, Volume 98, May 23, 2012, Board of Governors of the
   Federal Reserve System.
