   Here's who is on track to win the elections for the San Jose mayor and
   Santa Clara County Sheriff races.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- The race for mayor of San Jose and Sheriff of
   Santa Clara County featured two candidates with years of experience
   working in the South Bay and two relatively new faces to the area.

   And so far, it has been those newcomers leading the results.

   Matt Mahan and Bob Jonsen took early leads in their races, touted by
   many as "outsider" candidates.

   They told us someone who has a new look at old problems in South Bay is
   exactly what voters have been looking for.

   We spoke to Mahan today and Jonsen last week.

   "I think it's clear the voters want new leadership," Jonsen said on
   Nov. 2. "One with a fresh perspective and one that has the experience
   to deliver the reform that's necessary."

   "I think they want to hear us acknowledge that on homelessness, crime
   and affordable housing, we're moving in the wrong direction," Mahan
   said. "And, while we don't have total control over everything that
   happens in society, we need public policy to make things better."

   Mayoral candidate Cindy Chavez and sheriff Candidate Kevin Jensen both
   have years of experience working in the South Bay -- both are trailing.

   Chavez was unavailable to speak today, but told us last week there's no
   insider or outsider as she and Mahan have both worked in leadership
   roles.

   She recognizes that voters want change, but she said she wants it as
   well.

   "We've got to get San Jose clean if we really want to see it safer.
   That really is the only path," Chavez said on Nov. 2. "I think that
   requires a level of experience and relationships in the community that
   will allow us to move a lot of people in a better direction."

   Jensen meanwhile recognizes he is seen as the insider, but told us
   today that voters not recognizing he's been internally trying to fix
   issues attributed to former Sheriff Laurie Smith is unfair.

   "I think you're right," Jensen said. "I think the people are looking
   for change. I've been calling for change for 12 years, and it's hard to
   get people to understand the nuances of a race and not just the
   topical, 'Here's a little about each race. I'm going to make my vote.'"

   SJSU Political Science Professor Melinda Jackson told us even if the
   candidates feel they may not fit their insider or outsider mold, she
   thinks voters are making their feelings known.

   "Voters are becoming impatient and really wanting faster progress on
   these issues," Jackson said.

   The Registrar of voters is trying to process the majority of the
   ballots within the next week.
