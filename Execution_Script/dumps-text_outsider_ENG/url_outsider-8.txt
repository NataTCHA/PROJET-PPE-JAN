Prince Harry treated as 'outsider' by King Charles

Prince Harry's UK trip has "awakened some misery in him"

   Prince Harry treated as outsider by King Charles

   Prince Harry's recent visit to the UK has "awakened some misery in
   him", a biographer has claimed.

   Tom Bower, the author of royal book Revenge, claimed that the Duke of
   Sussex was an "outsider" and "so cut off" from family at the Queen's
   funeral.

   Harry was not allowed to wear his military uniform at the funeral, and
   the Duke and his wife Meghan were reportedly not invited to attend the
   state reception hosted at Buckingham Palace.

   "I think the funeral awakened some misery in him that he was so cut off
   from his family and friends and was an outsider," Bower told Page Six.

   According to the expert, Harry returned to the US with some bad
   memories and was not happy with the treatment of his royal relatives
   during the Queen's funeral.
