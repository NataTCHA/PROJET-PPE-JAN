Feeling friendly to a stranger

   Feeling friendly to a stranger. September. 24, 2022 07:27. by Yang-Hwan
   Jung ray@donga.com.
   It surely is one of the most overwhelming book titles I've encountered
   this year. The author says you should make the first move and "talk to
   a stranger" when it would feel uncomfortable even to be talked to by a
   stranger. I don't even tell my kids to talk to strangers first. I just
   know that I would never be able to do what the author recommends even
   if what he says is completely right and convincing.
   The writer must have predicted reactions such as I had. As a freelance
   journalist operating in the U.S., he says the conversation with a
   stranger is not just a way of life but a survival strategy. He even
   says that humanity has evolved by welcoming, communicating, and
   building relationships with strangers. At this point when he invokes
   our great forefathers, it's hard not to reconsider what he has to say.
   It is challenging to talk to someone you don't know in a society where
   people are busy staring into their smartphones in the subway and
   elsewhere. You might even be wrongfully accused of being a pervert or a
   crazy person. The author, however, insists that if you look into that
   stranger's eyes, find petty stuff in common, and successfully make a
   conversation, then a "whole new world" will unfold in front of you,
   just like in a movie. The author believes that deep down, everyone
   wants to be talked to.
   The book's publisher may disagree, but if you are busy, you can skip
   Parts 1 and 2 and just read Part 3 to get the gist. Despite numerous
   appealing sentences, the first two parts have no distinct conclusions
   so that you may think, "so what?" Part 3, however, contains the
   author's anecdotal experiences of talking to strangers. They are pretty
   helpful as they offer you the tips and right "skills" to strike a
   successful conversation with a stranger. The author has a knack for
   making you laugh at first and then inspiring you right on with those
   anecdotes.
   As I said, even though what the author says is convincing, it may be
   difficult to implement immediately. The world would be perfect if
   everything were so easy to follow. Still, those passers-by you
   encounter on the bus or on the street may feel different once you
   finish the book. At the end of the day, we are all lonely individuals
   isolated on each of our own islands. One day, I will talk to a stranger
   first, with the help of propranolol, of course.
