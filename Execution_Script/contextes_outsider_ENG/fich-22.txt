   Anna Zemánková, No title, 1960s

   Outsider art is art made by self-taught or supposedly naïve artists
   with typically little or no contact with the conventions of the art
   worlds. In many cases, their work is discovered only after their
   deaths. Often, outsider art illustrates extreme mental states,
   unconventional ideas, or elaborate fantasy worlds.

   The term outsider art was coined in 1972 as the title of a book by art
   critic Roger Cardinal.^[1] It is an English equivalent for art brut
   (French: [aʁ bʁyt], "raw art" or "rough art"), a label created in the

   spiritualists.^[2]^[3]

   Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an
   annual Outsider Art Fair^[4] has taken place in New York since 1993,
   and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to
   the subject. The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing
   label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream "art
   world" or "art gallery system", regardless of their circumstances or
   the content of their work.^[5] A more specific term, "outsider music",
   was later adapted for musicians.

Cultural context[edit]

   The interest in "outsider" practices among twentieth-century artists
   and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection
   of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part

   controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by
   way of an agreed vocabulary". Consequently, they lament the use of
   "outsider artist" to refer to almost any untrained artist. "It is not
   enough to be untrained, clumsy or naïve. Outsider Art is virtually
   synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of
   art produced by those who do not know its name."

       broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and
       decorative skill – everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap
       buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that
       folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values,
       where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to
       society's mainstream.
     * Intuitive art/Visionary art: Raw Vision Magazine's preferred
       general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate
       umbrella terms. However, visionary art, unlike other definitions
       here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which
       includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art
       is probably the most general term available. Intuit: The Center for
       Intuitive and Outsider Art based in Chicago operates a museum
       dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider
       art. The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is
       dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art.

       conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do
       outsider artists.
