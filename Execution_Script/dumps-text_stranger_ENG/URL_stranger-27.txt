Who Is a Stranger?

Defining a Stranger

   A stranger is anyone that your family doesn't know well. It's common
   for children to think that "bad strangers" look scary, like the
   villains in cartoons. This is not only not true, but it's dangerous for
   children to think this way. Pretty strangers can be just as dangerous
   as the not-so-pretty ones. When you talk to your children about
   strangers, explain that no one can tell if strangers are nice or not
   nice just by looking at them and that they should be careful around all
   strangers.

   But don't make it seem like all strangers are bad. If children need
   help-whether they're lost, being threatened by a bully, or being
   followed by a stranger-the safest thing for them to do in many cases is
   to ask a stranger for help. You can make this easier for them by
   showing them which strangers are okay to trust.

Who Are Safe Strangers?

   Safe strangers are people children can ask for help when they need it.
   Police officers and firefighters are two examples of very recognizable
   safe strangers. Teachers, principals, and librarians are adults
   children can trust too, and they are easy to recognize when they're at
   work. But make sure that you emphasize that whenever possible, children
   should go to a public place to ask for help.

   You can help your children recognize safe strangers by pointing them
   out when you're out in your town. Also show your children places they
   can go if they need help, such as local stores and restaurants and the
   homes of family friends in your neighborhood.
