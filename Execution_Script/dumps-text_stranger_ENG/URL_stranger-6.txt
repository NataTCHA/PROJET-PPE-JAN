Mysterious reflections on Mars might come from something stranger than water

   Scientists hoped it was a lake under the ice, but it may just be a
   mirage.

   Scientists revisiting a mysterious signal from the south pole of Mars
   have suggested a new potential explanation, and it doesn't bode well
   for hopes of finding liquid water on the Red Planet.

   In 2018, scientists using data from the European Space Agency's Mars
   Express orbiter's Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere
   Sounding (MARSIS) instrument announced that they'd observed a radar
   signal that could be interpreted as evidence of liquid water. That
   signal, a strange bright reflection, came from the Martian south pole
   in a region known as Ultima Scopuli. Researchers investigating the
   reflection now suggest that the signal didn't come from the ice itself,
   or even from liquid water, but from underlying geological layers made
   of minerals and frozen carbon dioxide. In particular, it turned out
   that the thickness of these layers, rather than what they're made of,
   creates the otherworldly reflection.

   On Earth, dazzling reflections like this often come from liquid water.
   For example, subglacial lakes like Antarctica's Lake Vostok, which has
   been lying under more than 2 miles (3 kilometers) of ice for millions
   of years, causes a bright radar signal like that found on Mars.
   However, just because it's possible for something like this to have
   also occurred on Mars doesn't guarantee the presence of liquid water.

   The research team used radar data from MARSIS, along with computer
   simulations, to investigate this mystery. The scientists simulated
   layers of ice and other substances, like basalt rock that formed after
   ancient volcanic eruptions on Mars, to see how these materials  would
   react to incoming light.

   Because there is an immense amount of carbon dioxide frozen in the
   Martian south pole, Cornell University planetary scientist and lead
   author of the research Dan Lalich was sure to include layers of this
   ice in the simulations. And one simulation in particular, with a layer
   of carbon dioxide ice and below the water ice, revealed that the
   separation and thickness of layers determined the strength of a
   reflection.

   Previous studies Lalich worked on also found that certain minerals
   could also conjure a reflection like this. He believes that even layers
   of the Red Planet's dust-obscured ice are capable of it. Either way, no
   liquid water is necessary to create the reflection.

   "I could have used rock layers or even particularly dusty water ice and
   I would have gotten similar results," he said in a statement. "The
   point of this paper is really that the composition of the basal layers
   is less important than the layer thicknesses and separations."

   The new research doesn't mean that there is no chance of liquid water
   existing somewhere on Mars, however.

   "None of the work we’ve done disproves the possible existence of liquid
   water down there," Lalich said. "We just think the interference
   hypothesis is more consistent with other observations. I'm not sure
   anything short of a drill could prove either side of this debate
   definitively right or wrong."

   Whether under a glacier or deep beneath the planet's scorched reddish
   surface, water — and possibly traces of life or — may still be lurking
   somewhere.

   The research is described in a paper published Sept. 28 in Nature
   Astronomy (opens in new tab).
