Tunisia: ex-president to be questioned over passports for foreigners

   Tunisia's former President Hammadi Jbali is facing a Tunisian court to
   explain a potential link between himself and Youssef Nada and Ghaleb
   Hemmet, two men who obtained Tunisian passports in the 1970s which were
   renewed at the end of 2012 months after the decision of the European
   Court of Human Rights that Egyptian businessman Nada's rights had been
   violated by the Swiss authorities, which placed restrictions on his
   movement across borders.

   That decision was taken after Nada was accused by the US of helping to
   finance the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He was placed on a sanctions list
   approved by the UN Security Council, which placed travel restrictions
   on those listed.

   In Nada's case no evidence against him was ever found, but he remained
   trapped in an Italian enclave within Switzerland for several years.
   "Switzerland should have taken all possible measures, within the
   latitude available to it, to adapt the sanctions regime to the
   applicant's individual situation," ruled the court in Strasbourg. The
   Swiss government was ordered to pay Nada $31,550 to cover his costs and
   expenses.

   A court in Tunisia is now checking if Nada, 92, has any link with
   terrorism. Critics of President Kais Saied describe this as "nonsense"
   and an example of him using the law for political purposes.

   On 23 January, Arabi21 published a series of documents which appear to
   confirm that Nada and Hemmat were granted the Tunisian nationality
   legally, with official approval of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs
   and Justice and the Tunisian consulates in the Austrian capital,
   Vienna, and the Swiss city of Bern.

   These official documents included the certificate of nationality issued
   by the Tunisian ambassador in Vienna to Youssef Nada, the registration
   card signed by the Tunisian ambassador in April 1981, the certificate
   of Tunisian nationality issued by the Ministry of Justice in Tunisia on
   19 February 1983, and the letter from the head of the Nationality
   Authority in Tunisia on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 14
   March 1983.
