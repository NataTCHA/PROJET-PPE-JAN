England-born Ike Ugbo hoping to shed ‘outsider’ label with goals for Canada

   The time on the clock was creeping into the wee morning hours where he
   was in Belgium, but after what Ike Ugbo had just witnessed on TV, he
   couldn’t sit still.

   At BMO Field in Toronto, the Canada men’s team had just come back to
   beat Panama 4-1 on the sixth matchday of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying
   with an entertaining, full-throttle approach. Qualifying for the World
   Cup for the first time since 1986 began to look like a possibility.

   With the sun starting to appear, Ugbo, 24, decided he wanted in on the
   experience. He fired off a text message to Canada centre-back Doneil
   Henry – five years Ugbo’s senior, but a familiar face because the two
   had grown up five minutes apart in Brampton, Ontario.

   “He was megging me when I was in grade five, and we used to beat him
   up,” said Henry, with a smile.

   Ugbo asked Henry how he could get involved in the Canada team. A
   talented product of the Chelsea academy, Ugbo had bounced around on
   loan deals, leading to questions about his long-term potential. Henry
   posed a question of his own in response to Ugbo’s text: Do you have the
   right mentality to play on this team?

   Ugbo insisted he did, so Henry passed the message over to Canada head
   coach John Herdman.

   Herdman had inquired about Ugbo’s availability to play for Canada early
   in his tenure as head coach, but was told by Chelsea staff that Ugbo
   was only interested in representing England after playing for several
   of their youth national teams. Still, Ugbo remained eligible to play
   for Canada. And as a vital forward in an attack-minded Canada squad,
   the World Cup could finally be the time for the AC Troyes man, long
   considered an outsider in Chelsea’s ranks and whose career has taken
   winding turns, to deliver on years of promise, and carve out a place
   for himself.

   When Ugbo closed his eyes and thought about being four years old and
   playing soccer in Brampton, two images came to mind.

   “Scoring a lot of goals,” he said with a smile. “And, our jerseys were
   sponsored by Tim Hortons.”

   Born in London, Ugbo moved to Canada with his mother and sisters while
   still in preschool. His father remained in the UK to work, but traveled
   between the two countries often. When his father was with him, he would
   regale his son with stories of the Nigeria team at the 1994 World Cup,
   who topped their group.

   As fate would have it, his family had moved to what would eventually
   become the soccer capital of Canada, home to some of the country’s best
   players,  including Atiba Hutchinson, Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan Osorio
   and, of course, Henry.

   “When I look back, I can see how much growth Canada has had, and how
   far Canada has come to where we are today,” said Ugbo.

   Eventually, the distance between the family became too great and Ugbo,
   then nine, and his family returned to England. Ugbo began playing
   recreationally there, but readily admits that, having grown up in
   Canada, he failed to understand just how deeply entrenched soccer is in
   England’s national psyche.

   After a few months playing as a midfielder in a friendly Sunday league,
   Ugbo was approached by a Chelsea scout offering a chance to train at
   their academy.

   “At the time, I didn’t see it as big as it was,” he said.

   He was playing as a No. 10, but after changes in the squad forced him
   to move to striker as a 16-year-old, he was able to stay in the
   position because of his natural instincts for finishing.

   “You learn different types of movements needed,” said Ugbo. “When I
   made the transition, I brought things that I had to use while playing
   in midfield. It just clicks well.”

   For the majority of his time in the Chelsea academy, highlighted by
   UEFA Youth League titles in 2015 and 2016, things clicked for him. He
   signed his first professional contract with Chelsea in 2015.

   But almost immediately, his eyes became bigger than his stomach. As a
   17-year-old he thought, I have to play first team football as soon as
   possible.

   “I was ready to learn everything from a young age, including the
   difficulties,” he said.

   Joining a Chelsea first team with Premier League and Champions League
   title aspirations wasn’t possible. His father wanted him to get outside
   of his comfort zone and go abroad. Instead, Ugbo went on loan with
   Barnsley in the EFL Championship. Regular playing time and goals did
   not come. The same was the case for his loan to League One side MK Dons
   for the second half of the 2017-18 season, as well as his loan to
   another League One side, Scunthorpe United, for 2018-19.

   He had rushed into his professional career, scoring just five goals
   across those three teams in his two seasons on loan.

   “It looked like maybe I wasn’t ready, and you could say that,” Ugbo
   said. “I was still a kid. I had to learn fast.”

   This shock was coupled with living away from home for the first time,
   and the new responsibilities he had to learn — be it maintaining a
   clean apartment or eating healthy. He struggled with the latter, to the
   point that it negatively impacted his performances.

   “Your body is asking for more than in Under-23’s football because the
   intensity is even higher,” he said. “It was a real shock to me at the
   time.”

   During his scoring drought and frequent moves, he wondered whether he’d
   succeed as a professional soccer player.

   “Sometimes there were doubts through the first two loans, for sure,” he
   said. “Like, ‘Where’s my level?’”

   Conversations with those closest to him all eventually came to the same
   conclusion: the teams he was trying to crack would not change their
   approach to fit Ugbo. Instead, he needed to better understand his
   surroundings.

   “You have to be quicker at adapting to the team’s tactics,” he said of
   what he learned through his first few failed loan spells. “I don’t
   think many coaches will change the tactics for you.”

   He employed that mentality when he finally did get out of his comfort
   zone with a loan to JC Roda in the Dutch second division. His 13 goals
   in 28 league matches bolstered his confidence through the 2019-20
   season, as did the 16 goals he scored in 32 matches on loan in
   Belgium’s top flight with Cercle Brugge. He now had the belief
   instilled in him from Cercle Brugge head coach (and former Chelsea
   assistant) Paul Clement of his potential as a scorer in a European top
   flight. Ugbo found himself asking more questions of Clement than he
   ever had of any previous manager to better understand how he could be
   effective.

   The conclusion of the 2020-21 season brought the end of Ugbo’s Chelsea
   contract. But for the first time in his career he had the confidence
   and agency over his career that he never did while bouncing from loan
   move to loan move. Ugbo had finally learned what qualities made him his
   most dangerous on the pitch.

   “A nuisance,” he said. “Being everywhere and being clinical. Not
   needing many chances, just one or two, to score. That’s when I’m at
   best.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ugbo’s goal-scoring put him on the radar of multiple national teams. In
   September 2021, as Ugbo was beginning to find the back of the net with
   Genk on a new permanent deal in the Belgian first division, he publicly
   stated that he would represent Nigeria. The chance to play in the 2022
   World Cup was a driving factor.

   Quietly, Ugbo still hesitated with his decision. He says now that he
   never heard from then-Nigeria national team coach Gernot Rohr
   throughout the process.

   “And,” he added, “I never grew up in Nigeria, either.”

   His first conversation with Herdman in October 2021 changed everything.

   “(Herdman) knew about me from when I was at Chelsea,” Ugbo said. “He
   knew exactly what I was going through. He spoke to me about the
   ambitions of Canada and what he’s trying to do and what he’d already
   done. Already I could see, without him telling me, the direction Canada
   was going in.”

   The Canada national team’s upward trajectory matched his own. He
   committed to Canada just before they departed for Edmonton and earned
   two crucial wins in November 2021 against Costa Rica and Mexico to go
   to the top of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying table.

   “He adapted well, right when he came on the team,” said fellow Canada
   forward Lucas Cavallini.

   This includes connecting with teammates about fashion, which he sees as
   an outlet to express his personality. During the team’s June camp in
   Vancouver, Henry took Ugbo to some of his favourite clothing spots on
   Robson Street. Henry’s guidance helped turn Ugbo on to new designers.

   But even Henry, who takes more fashion risks than his teammates, was
   taken aback.

   “Some of the things that he would wear, I would never wear,” Henry
   said, cracking a quick smile. “It’s just offside for me.”

   During the June camp, Ugbo gained enough confidence to start imparting
   some of his own personality on other teammates – for example, having
   noticed that Cavallini’s Spotify playlists relied too heavily on
   reggaeton, Ugbo grabbed Cavallini’s phone and added more American
   hip-hop to the mix in this past June’s international window.

   “He introduced me to some artists that I never used to listen to,” said
   Cavallini, “but now he’s got me hooked on them.”

   Ugbo is also making an impression on the pitch. He can use his
   instincts to quickly get inside of defenders before using his strength
   to maintain that positioning. Crucially, he can be a clinical finisher
   close to goal.

   “(Ugbo) always finds himself in the right situations,” said Canada
   teammate Jonathan David. “When his back is against the goal, he’s very
   good at holding the ball up, twisting, turning in and finding his way
   out.”

   But in a World Cup year, Ugbo’s potential is hardly as important as his
   current output. It took longer than Ugbo wanted to sign a permanent
   deal with Troyes ahead of this season, which cut into his pre-season
   and training camp. He looked sluggish, playing with a heavy touch early
   in the season. Ugbo only began to move more fluidly and find more
   scoring opportunities in September.

   Ugbo’s next step will be taking on more of a prominent role in the
   Canada team and extinguishing that outsider tag once and for all.

   “I think that can only be established through performance,” Herdman
   told The Athletic. “(He) would probably walk into another position on
   the field, but in that forward line with Jonathan David, Alphonso
   Davies, Cyle Larin, Junior Hoilett and Tajon Buchanan, that’s a tough
   group to break. So with Ike, it’s about a massive season for Troyes.”

   Still, there is a potential window of opportunity for Ugbo to make a
   mark. Cavallini occupies a similar No. 9 role as Ugbo, but with his
   Vancouver Whitecaps falling short of the MLS playoffs, Cavallini didn’t
   get regular playing time heading into the World Cup. Larin is Canada’s
   all-time leading scorer, but regular minutes at Club Brugge have been
   few and far between.

   Then there is the matter of tactical flexibility, something Herdman
   demanded of the 10 forwards he invited to Canada’s September camp.
   Could Ugbo adapt to a new role, as opposed to a typical goal-front
   poacher for Canada? Will that be the final step to him earning a start
   at the World Cup?

   Ugbo sincerely hopes so.

   “The performances in your club team, especially for me, it’s just about
   goals and assists, making sure I’m performing on a regular basis, no
   matter the team,” said Ugbo.

   He spoke in a more serious tone, before his child-like smile appeared
   again.

   After bouncing around for most of his career, ahead of the World Cup,
   he’s finally found where he can have the most important impact of his
   career to date.

   “I feel this (Canada’s national team) is where I belong.”
