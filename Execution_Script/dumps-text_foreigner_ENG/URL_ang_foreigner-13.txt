   The average home price in Canada has skyrocketed to over $800,000.
   Globe and Mail real estate reporter Rachelle Younglai tells NPR's Sacha
   Pfeiffer how parliament hopes to address the crisis.

   SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:

   Earlier in the program, we talked about the challenges of buying a
   house in the United States right now in Canada. There's also a housing
   crisis. Real estate prices there have become stratospheric. So in its
   national budget this spring, the Canadian federal government made a
   proposal to address the problem - a two-year ban on home sales to
   foreign buyers. But how would prohibiting foreigners from buying houses
   in Canada affect the Canadian real estate market? We're going to put
   that question to Rachelle Younglai. She covers real estate for the
   Globe and Mail in Toronto. Hi, Michelle.

   RACHELLE YOUNGLAI: Hi.

   PFEIFFER: Rachelle, here in the United States, the housing market is
   also just bonkers. If you're a seller, you're probably happy. If you're
   a buyer, you're probably demoralized. Would you give us a sense of what
   the market is like in Canada, including whether this is just a big-city
   problem or everywhere?

   YOUNGLAI: It's an everywhere problem. It's a national problem. Over the
   past two years, house prices have gone up by 50%. The typical home
   price in Canada across the country is over $800,000. It's a huge
   problem. And that's what we're dealing with right now.

   PFEIFFER: So the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, wants to lock
   foreign buyers out of the market. But how much of the Canadian housing
   market is even owned by foreign buyers? And would you expect to see any
   real impact from that kind of ban?

   YOUNGLAI: Well, the latest data shows that foreign owners own a very
   small share of the housing stock. In Ontario, for example, they own
   2.2% of homes. In British Columbia, they own 3.1%. That was data as of
   2020. So it's a very, very small share. And we also have an idea that
   domestic buyers, Canadian buyers, were behind the latest real estate
   boom, not foreign buyers. So I would say this ban will not have a huge
   impact on home prices here.

   PFEIFFER: Then why would the country propose that ban at all?

   YOUNGLAI: I think it's politically convenient since foreigners can't
   vote here. They're an easy scapegoat. And that's, I mean, I think one
   of the main reasons.

   PFEIFFER: Rachelle, here in the U.S., people depressed by American
   politics sometimes joke or maybe not always joke - maybe they're
   serious - that they want to move to Canada. If these people hear about
   this proposed ban, they might think that their window of opportunity is
   closing. But this proposal has a lot of loopholes. So is it not as
   draconian as it sounds?

   YOUNGLAI: Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, there are lots of exemptions. So,
   for example, if you are a foreign student and you intend to make Canada
   your home, you are allowed to buy. If you're a foreign worker with a
   visa, you can also buy. If you're married to a Canadian, you can buy.
   And also, it's a two-year ban. So you could always wait. And the other
   thing is it's not even - it's not a law yet.

   PFEIFFER: It's still a proposal.

   YOUNGLAI: It's still a proposal. Right.

   PFEIFFER: So interesting. I mean, as you're saying, it sounds like it's
   not as scary sounding as the headline makes it seem. And if banning
   foreigners from buying homes in Canada is unlikely to free up more
   houses, are unlikely to bring prices down, and it's more of a domestic
   problem, then what else does the Canadian government think would help?
   Because I've read, for example, that there are also proposals to boost
   construction and help first time homebuyers save for a down payment.
   Anything else on the table?

   YOUNGLAI: Yeah. They have another plan to prevent people from flipping
   their houses. So they have a proposal to tax you if you sell your house
   within a year of buying it. So that's that's one plan. You mentioned
   the boost in construction. One of their plans is to double or to try to
   increase the pace of construction. It's not really clear whether that
   will work either, because we, like your country, are facing a labor
   shortage, especially in trades. So even if cities were on board to
   increase the pace of construction, there is no one to do the work.

   PFEIFFER: And it also sounds like none of these are quick fixes that
   are going to overnight make the home market, the housing market more
   accessible. So I have a bigger picture question for you, which is if
   homeownership is a goal in an ideal for so many people, I mean, here in
   the U.S., it's central to that concept of the American dream, do
   Canadians just need to lower their expectations about someday owning a
   home and think about renting as a good long-term option?

   YOUNGLAI: Yeah, for sure. For sure. I mean, it's a huge goal for
   Canadians, too. Most Canadians don't want to rent. They want to own.
   And people always talk about how we should look at Europe. People rent
   and they're fine with renting. But Canadians are not fine with renting.
   They want to own. So yeah, it is a shift in thinking. We're definitely
   not there yet.

   PFEIFFER: Rachelle Younglai is a reporter with the Globe and Mail.
   Thank you very much for talking about this.

   YOUNGLAI: Thank you.
