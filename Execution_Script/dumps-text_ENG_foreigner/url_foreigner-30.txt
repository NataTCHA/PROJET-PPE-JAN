Balearic Islands government may restrict foreigners from owning property
there

   Balearic Islands government may restrict foreigners from owning
   property there

   One-third of homes on the islands this year were sold to nationals of
   other countries, many of whom are non-residents

   Last week, the regional government of the Balearic Islands decided to
   create a working group, which will have the task of studying the legal
   possibility of limiting the purchasing powers of foreign nationals in
   the housing market there. The reason behind this drastic move is the
   fact that high purchasing incidence from foreign buyers is driving the
   price of housing often beyond the reach of locals.

   Banning the outright purchase of properties by EU nationals, however,
   would likely be impossible as it would clash with EU legislation, the
   rules of the common market and the freedom of movement of people and
   capital.

   The group is already working on the preparation of an initial report on
   the current European regulatory situation, which prevents the
   limitation of the purchase of properties by foreigners from states of
   the European Union.

   From now on, the group will analyze the existing experiences in the
   European sphere and the international community to draw conclusions
   applicable to the situation of the Islands. Apparently, there’s already
   precedence in the case of Denmark, but this exclusion had been
   specifically written into its EU-accession treaty. The initiative
   called for the report to be delivered in one year.

The islands’ attractiveness is the cause of its housing crisis, too

   Without a doubt, the Balearic Archipelago is very attractive for buyers
   of other nationalities, either as a second residence or as
   an investment. The dean of the Association of Registrars of the
   Balearic Islands, José Luis Jiménez-Herrera, explained to Ultima Hora,
   that the sunny climate, as well as good transport connections and legal
   certainty, are some of the main attractions of this Spanish region.

   So much so that this year alone, 35.1% of the housing units on offer in
   the Balearics were snatched up by non-Spanish nationals. This makes the
   archipelago, the Spanish region with the highest percentage of property
   sales to citizens of other countries. For comparison, the national
   average sits at 14.14%.

   The main buyers are predominantly from northern Europe – British,
   Germans and Scandinavians. What’s more, many of them buy the units
   without having to resort to mortgages.
