   It was supposed to bear her name, Saman's name-- the law that would
   have helped girls like the young girl of Pakistani-origin, killed,
   because she rebelled against an arranged marriage and wished for the
   tools to be free. To say "No" to family-imposed obligations without
   running the risk of being coerced. But the law never made it to final
   approval.

   'Saman's law' cashed last April, its first yes vote with 385 votes in
   favor, no votes against, and 31 abstentions by deputies from Giorgia
   Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia; the same Meloni who is now the Prime
   Minister-to-be and who in the past, had been very vocal demanding
   justice for the victims.

   The proposed law takes its name from the case of an 18-year-old
   Pakistani-origin girl, Saman Abbas, living in Novellara, Italy since
   2016.

     She had asked for help from the police and social services to escape
     a marriage arranged by her family in Pakistan. She was living in a
     safe house since then but she had returned home recently, trusting
     her parents to retrieve some documents. Since then, she is missing.

More Pakistani Women in Italy Fall Victim To Honour Killing

   Her parents, suddenly returned to Pakistan due to an alleged
   bereavement while the rest of her family disappeared. There's a video
   showing her father, uncles and a cousin dragging a big plastic bag and
   a couple of shovels. Her younger brother, found living with relatives
   in a nearby village, says she has been killed by the family. Her uncles
   have later been arrested and confessed the crime while her parents are
   still in Pakistan where the country refuses extradition for them.

   Saman's body has not been recovered yet. Hers was the latest case of a
   long, bloodied string of Pakistani-origin girls being harrassed and
   killed in Italy.

   So long that, in 2019, Law No. 69/2019, the so-called "Red Code,"
   introduced a special criminal case to punish forced marriages. This
   provision stipulates that "Whoever, by violence or threat, forces a
   person to enter into marriage or civil union shall be punished by
   imprisonment from one to five years. The same punishment applies to
   anyone who, taking advantage of a person's conditions of vulnerability
   or mental inferiority or need, with abuse of family, domestic, labour
   relations or authority arising from the person's entrustment for
   reasons of care, education or upbringing, supervision or custody,
   induces him or her to contract marriage or civil union."

     Thus, aggravating circumstances when the acts are committed against
     an eighteen year old or a minor of 14 years. The provisions of the
     article also apply when the act is committed abroad by an Italian
     citizen or foreigner residing in Italy or to the detriment of an
     Italian citizen or a foreigner residing in Italy.

Forced Marriages Rampant Among South Asian Minors

   The Central Directorate of Criminal Police of the Department of Public
   Security has recently published the first Report on the "Red Code" Law
   which is aimed at analysing the phenomenon with the goal of countering
   it. From 9 August 2019 -- the date of its entry into force to 31
   December 2021, there has been an increase in 'forced marriages.'

   Fifty-nine percent of the victims are foreigners, mostly Pakistani,
   followed by Albanian. In 73% of cases the perpetrators were
   predominantly Pakistani, Albanian, Bengali, and Bosnian men. The data,
   moreover, is not accurate, because the "underground" is missing.

   This crime, in fact, often takes place within the walls of the home and
   the victims are almost always young girls, forced to drop out of
   school, sometimes forced to remain locked in the house in the
   impossibility of reporting, even for fear of retaliation and do not
   even know who to turn to.

     'Saman's law' was intended to go a step further stating that those
     who denounce the coercion to marry could obtain the issuance of a
     residence permit for humanitarian reasons, for a duration of one
     year, renewable as long as the humanitarian needs that justified its
     issuance, persist.

   The immediate issuance of a residence permit to the victim will ensure
   that she can break free from the family of origin and no longer have to
   go back to his or her parents to beg for his or her papers, risking his
   or her life, as what happened to Saman. The law will also help girls
   who are still forced to live with their parents and follow their rules
   for all its difficulties, to get a residence permit on their own.

Can Meloni Govt Back Immigrant Womens’ Rights?

   The second generations are forced to carry the burden of the
   traditionalist Pakistani culture they are not part of, a culture very
   different from the culture of the country where they were born or
   raised. The Saman law will be a light in the dark for them.

   It is not clear why Meloni's parlamentarians did not vote Saman's law,
   given her strong campaigning against the 'culture' pushing mainly
   Pakistani immigrants to kill or harras their daughters in Italy.

   At anti-violence centers and social services, there are dozens of girls
   seeking help and trying to escape from unions arranged against their
   consent. They come mostly from Pakistan or Bangladesh, and are between
   16 and 25 years old. Let's hope that the first Italian woman Prime
   Minister will do the right thing and Saman's law will be passed without
   further discussion.

   Let's hope Saman, Hina, Sana and all the other Pakistani-origin girls
   killed by their families did not die in vain, and there will be justice
   for them. There's no honour in killing, and no 'culture' can justify
   the massacre of its daughters, in Italy or abroad. Never.
