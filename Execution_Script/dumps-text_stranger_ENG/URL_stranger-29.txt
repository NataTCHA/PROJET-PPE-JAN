   Stephanie Cole was a frightened teen on her first day at a new job.
   When she froze during a transaction, a customer had some kind words for

   This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain
   team, about people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone
   else.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The first day at a new job can be hard. Especially when it's your first
   job ever, and you're starting during the Christmas rush.

   Stephanie Cole's first job as a teenager was in retail, working at a
   busy department store in 1960s Los Angeles.

   "There I was in my black skirt and my white blouse, and ready to go the
   first day," Cole recalled.

   Her training had been quick, and the store was now bustling with people
   trying to finish their holiday shopping. It wasn't long before a woman
   walked up to her cash register with a Christmas tree ornament that she
   wanted to buy. Cole froze.

   "All of a sudden, I can't remember anything. I can't remember how to
   run the cash register. I can't remember anything about the
   transactions. I am just absolutely frozen and probably very close to
   tears," she said.

   She'd wanted this first job to go well, and it was already going very
   wrong. But the woman looked at her with a kind expression and said,
   "It's alright. Take your time. I'm not in a hurry."

   Cole felt a sense of relief when she heard those words. "All of a
   sudden, I could breathe, I could wait till somebody else could help me.
   It was gonna be okay."

   The moment was a small one long ago, but the woman's kindness affected
   how Cole has interacted with people ever since.

   "She gave me that gift without knowing she gave me that gift. And it's
   lasted all these years," Cole said.

   "You know, you encounter somebody who's . . . just having a bad day and
   things are really, you can tell they're in a bad place, and you can
   say, 'It's okay. I'm not in a hurry. Take your time.' And it always
   makes the situation better. Always, always."

   My Unsung Hero is also a podcast â€” new episodes are released every
