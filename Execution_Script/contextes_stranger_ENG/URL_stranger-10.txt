   Last Friday marked National Sit With a Stranger Day, a holiday created
   in 2020 to encourage people to make new connections with others, even
   if they’ve never met. The following vignettes are stories from people
   who spent their Saturday on Syracuse University’s campus. From
   volunteers to a new fiancé, SU was chock full of strangers to sit with,
   learn from and talk to this weekend. And, through these conversations
   with The Daily Orange, may be a little less than strangers now.
