   Opposite Of Stranger, Antonyms of Stranger, Meaning and Example
   Sentences
   [INS: :INS]

   [INS: :INS]

   Antonym opposite words contradict each other and meet opposite
   meanings. A word has synonyms as well as antonyms. When we learn a
   language, when we learn a word in that language, it will be very useful
   for us to learn both the opposite and the synonyms of this word.

   Because learning a word with its synonyms increases our competence in
   that language as well as our competence in speaking and writing.
   Learning a word with its opposite meanings both broadens our vocabulary
   and helps our activity on language. There are some things we need to
   know about opposite words.

   First, the negative of a word cannot be the opposite of that
   word. Negative words indicate whether an action should be taken to us,
   that is, not the opposite meaning of a word. In a language, not every
   word has a synonym, but not every word has an opposite. In general,
   adjectives and adverbs have opposite meanings, that is, words reporting
   quality and quantity often have opposite words.

   Stranger means; alien, foreigner, outsider, unknown, gringo
