Matt Rhule named as lively outsider for open college coaching vacancy

   Carolina Panthers head coach Matt Rhule has been named as a lively
   outside for a recently opened college football coaching vacancy.

   Until Matt Rhule turns the Carolina Panthers around, his name will
   either be in the firing line or linked with college vacancies.

   The former Baylor man might have a strong reputation for building
   programs back to relevancy. But this hasn’t translated to an NFL
   franchise yet and something that has many projecting his name to be the
   first removed in the ever-changing coaching cycle.

   Based on what’s transpired since Rhule took over from Ron Rivera in
   2020, he might be better suited to the collegiate ranks. The NFL isn’t
   for anybody, with many failing to make the jump before David Tepper
   shelled out $62 million to keep his guy out of the New York Giants’
   grasp.

   Rhule remains defiant despite Carolina’s complete lack of form. One win
   in 10 games and 24 straight defeats when an opposing team scores more
   than 17 points is a damning indictment of his ability to adjust and the
   constant change of quarterbacks hasn’t done him any favors, either.

Matt Rhule named as lively outside for vacant Wisconsin job

   When asked about his job status following the Panthers’ loss against
   the Arizona Cardinals, Rhule didn’t indicate anything had changed
   regarding Tepper’s unwavering support. However, the tipping point might
   not be too much further away given the tough stretch of games upcoming
   for the Panthers, which means things could get even worse in the coming
   weeks.

   The head coach didn’t disclose whether or not he had received offers to
   return to college. Rhule knows the job is far from finished in
   Carolina, but there could come a time when he needs to start thinking
   about reputation self-preservation in the wake of some glaring media
   criticism.

   One recent opening sees Wisconsin looking for a new man at the helm
   after parting ways with Paul Chryst. Although Rhule doesn’t appear
   willing to leave the Panthers right now, that hasn’t stopped him from
   being named as a lively outsider for the role.

   The recent odds on who’ll replace Chryst on bookies.com has Rhule at
   +3000 to take over at the Badgers. This places him as the eighth
   favorite to secure the job, meaning it’s unlikely but not entirely out
   of the question.

   Whether this is something Tepper is waiting for is also something to
   consider. Giving up a substantial sum to end this experiment short
   would likely sting, so waiting around for a college program to pick up
   the tab instead seems like a win-win for the billionaire.

   That probably won’t help Carolina’s chances of immediate progression.
   Rhule might also be waiting around for a more prominent school to call
   in pursuit of salvaging his reputation.

   Rhule seems likable. Even if he appears in way over his head at the
   next level.

   The same tendencies that brought Baylor and Temple back to prominence
   haven’t rubbed off positively on grown men at the peak of their powers.
   But everyone does appear to be pulling in the same direction despite
   having little to celebrate over the last three years.

   Frustrations are also growing to a breaking point within the fanbase,
   which has the scope to impact Tepper’s bottom line. If Rhule went to
   the college ranks without being pushed, then this would arguably solve
   a lot of problems for everyone involved if things continue trending on
   a downward curve.
