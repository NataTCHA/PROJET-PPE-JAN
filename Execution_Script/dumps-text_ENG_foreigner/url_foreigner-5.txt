EDITORIAL: Same-sex couples of Japanese and foreigners need equality in Japan

   While same-sex couples of two foreigners can live together in Japan if
   one of them has residence visa status, a foreigner married to a
   Japanese same-sex partner can be denied a resident visa.

   This inequality concerning the visa status of gay couples remains
   unaddressed. With a growing number of countries legalizing same-sex
   marriages, the government should prioritize tackling this problem.

   In its Sept. 30 ruling on a case where a gay American man sought to
   obtain a visa to live with his Japanese partner, the Tokyo District
   Court said that the government’s failure to grant him a long-term
   residency status was illegal since it violates the constitutional
   principle of equality.

   The justice and immigration control authorities should take the court’s
   decision seriously.

   The American man has cried foul because he has been denied the right
   given to gay couples of two foreign nationals who have gotten married
   overseas with one of them holding residential status.

   In the case of such a foreign gay couple, the partner is granted a visa
   of the “designated activities” category for a long stay.

   But gay couples involving a Japanese partner are exempted from this
   special visa rule, which was introduced in 2013. That means it is
   difficult for the foreign partner of such gay couples to reside in
   Japan unless he or she obtains a resident visa based on his or her own
   occupation or other activities.

   The plaintiff in the lawsuit, Andrew High, and his Japanese partner
   registered their marriage in the United States in 2015 after the U.S.
   Supreme Court recognized same-sex marriages. High filed the suit three
   years ago after his application for a long-term resident visa as the
   partner of a Japanese citizen was rejected.

   The court pointed out that there is growing “demand for and interest
   in” same-sex marriages and same-sex partner systems and argued that
   Japanese-foreigner couples should be given equal treatment as
   foreigner-only couples.

   The court criticized the current system in which the residence status
   visa of the designated activities category is not granted equally to
   all gay couples, including a partner with a residence visa status, for
   running counter to the spirit of the Constitution, which upholds the
   principle of equality under the law.

   The court said High should have been granted a designated activities
   visa.

   In this century, same-sex marriages have spread globally. There are now
   more than 30 countries and areas where same-sex marriages are legal,
   according to the citizens group Marriage For All Japan.

   It is not uncommon for a Japanese national to be legally married to a
   same-sex partner overseas, the group says. But such Japanese-foreigner
   gay or lesbian couples face a major obstacle if they want to live
   together in Japan.

   This issue has long been recognized by the government. During a 2018
   session of the Upper House Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, then
   Foreign Minister Taro Kono said this was clearly wrong and the
   government was considering correcting the problem “in a forward-looking
   manner.”

   But there has been no improvement in the situation, apparently due to
   the government’s negligence.

   High and his Japanese partner have said they just want to live in Japan
   as a family. High can stay in Japan as a foreign resident by, for
   instance, obtaining a “business manager” visa as he actually did. But
   they should be granted the right to live in Japan as a family.

   The designated activities visa, which the ruling said should have been
   granted to High, imposes certain restrictions on holders’ activities,
   such as they cannot work without permission from the immigration
   control authority.

   The government should consider granting residence status as the spouse
   of a Japanese national to such foreign same-sex partners of Japanese
   citizens.

   The right to family unity, which means families have the right to live
   together, has been established under international human rights law.
   Japan should not remain a country where this right is not recognized or
   respected.
