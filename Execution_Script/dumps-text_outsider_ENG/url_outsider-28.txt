   While portrayals of immigrants and their descendants in France and
   throughout Europe often center on burning cars and radical
   Islam, Citizen Outsider: Children of North African Immigrants in
   France paints a different picture. Through fieldwork and interviews in
   Paris and its banlieues, Jean Beaman examines middle-class and upwardly
   mobile children of Maghrébin, or North African immigrants. By showing
   how these individuals are denied cultural citizenship because of their
   North African origin, she puts to rest the notion of a French
   exceptionalism regarding cultural difference, race, and ethnicity and
   further centers race and ethnicity as crucial for understanding
   marginalization in French society.

Reviews

     "Written in a straightforward and engaging style, ... ideal, not
     only for specialists of race and (im)migration in France and beyond,
     but also as a teaching tool for upper level undergraduate
     students."—Ethnic and Racial Studies

     “Offers a critical examination of a so-called colorblind society. A
     solid addition to courses on race, immigration, citizenship, or
     French studies.”—Migration Studies Review

     "A compelling case study for very real challenges facing France
     today."—Sociology of Race and Ethnicity

     "Both the empirical evidence and the theoretical frameworks that
     Beaman employs make important contributions to political and
     scholarly debates over race and immigration in France."—City and
     Community

     "Beaman offers a rich and stringent critique of the continued
     marginalization of French citizens deemed “outsiders” due
     to their race or ethnicity. ... This book is an excellent case study
     of race and immigration in France, suitable for scholars of race and
     ethnicity, and particularly well-suited for senior undergraduate
     students."—American Journal of Sociology

     "I highly recommend this monograph for classroom use in an
     upper-division undergraduate course in race-ethnicity or in a
     graduate-level seminar in race-ethnicity or stratification. I
     recommend this book to those who want a nuanced understanding of how
     immigration, ethnicity, race, and culture frame social inclusion for
     visible minorities in France today. Read this book cover to cover.
     Beaman delivers a sophisticated yet accessible comprehension of why
     the children of North African immigrants in France grow up to be
     citizen outsiders."—Social Forces

     "A methodologically sound, illuminating text that contributes to the
     literature on both immigration and the formation of racial theories
     at the global level."—Teaching Sociology

     "A well-crafted intervention, Citizen Outsider complicates
     discourses surrounding assimilation, integration, and European
     racial politics. . . . Discussions of migration sometimes shy away
     from explicitly naming the racist exclusionary practices which
     underpin the nation state, here Beaman triumphs by entirely centring
     the topic."—European Journal of Cultural and Political Sociology

   "Citizen Outsider takes place in a new thread of research on
   multicultural France. It's a fantastic journey into the minority
   experience of socially upwardly mobile North Africans. It uncovers the
   French 'racial project' and contributes brilliantly to an ongoing
   conversation on racial formation in a formally colorblind society. It
   is worth reading to take stock on racial formation in France."—Patrick
   Simon, Institut National d’Etudes Démographiques (National Institute
   for Demographic Studies), coeditor of Fear, Anxiety, and National
   Identity: Immigration and Belonging in North America and Western Europe

   "Jean Beaman's Citizen Outsider offers a trenchant analysis of the
   racial exclusions, indignities, and injustices experienced by French
   citizens of color. Distinguishing between formal and cultural
   citizenship, Beaman draws on extensive ethnographic evidence and
   interviews to substantiate the insight that physical presence falls
   significantly short of social belonging or acceptance. She traces the
   historical and material conditions underpinning the resulting racial
   tensions and political unsettlements. Citizen Outsider provides a
   compelling account of the social structures and expressions of racism
   in France today—and their individual and community resistances."—David
   Theo Goldberg, Director and Professor, University of California
   Humanities Research Institute, and author of Are We All Postracial Yet?
   "Whites in France lie to themselves and the world by proclaiming that
   they do not have institutional racism in their nation. Relying on
   interviews with second-generation, middle-class North African
   immigrants (a group that should be presumably 'integrated' and thus
   happy), Professor Beaman shatters this myth and shows the deep salience
   of race in the country. Bravo to Professor Beaman for clearly
   documenting how 'racism without racists' operates in the French
   context!"—Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, president of American Sociological
   Association and author of Racism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism
   and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America
   "Citizen Outsider brilliantly illuminates the significance of
   ethnoracial origins in France, a society whose national identity denies
   their importance. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants
   to understand the role of immigration in the widening social cleavages
   on both sides of the Atlantic."—Richard Alba, coauthor of Strangers No
   More: Immigration and the Challenges of Integration in North America
   and Western Europe

   "France's supposed colorblind Republican ideology has often led
   scholars to overlook or even ignore the complexities of race in France.
   Jean Beaman's work is an important contribution to the study of
   immigration and race in France, bringing the voices of
   second-generation North Africans into the debates around what it means
   to be French and what it means to be Maghrébin/Black at a time when the
   politics of immigration are creating volatile situations in
   the banlieus (suburbs) of France and fueling support for Far Right
   politicians. Beaman's contribution comes at a critical juncture in the
   study of immigration, race, and politics in Europe and should be read
   by students and scholars alike."—Terri E. Givens, Provost, Menlo
   College, and coauthor of Legislating Equality: The Politics of
   Antidiscrimination Policy in Europe
   "Skillfully combining attention to microlevel interaction and to the
   broader social environment, Jean Beaman offers a rich and provocative
   analysis of the cultural marginalization experienced by children of
   North African immigrants in France. She convincingly shows how
   ethnicity continues to separate individuals who have attained
   middle-class status, and how educational and occupational attainment
   can still leave some communities at the margins of society. She reveals
   the subtle and less subtle legacies of racial and ethnic inequalities
   inherited from a history of colonialism. This is a major and innovative
   contribution to the study of citizenship and immigration, a must-read
   for anyone interested in the topic."—Mounira M. Charrad, author of
   States and Women’s Rights: The Making of Postcolonial Tunisia, Algeria,
   and Morocco
   One beautiful part of this book is captured in the words of the people
   interviews because Jean Beaman largely supports her arguments with
   portraits and excerpts of interviews with those whom she calls
   ‘outside’ citizens, in reference to work conceptualizing the
   simultaneous dynamics of integration and social marginalization to
   explain the place of black minorities in American society … Despite
   trajectories that have allowed them to access higher education and
   positions in intermediate or managerial professions, the visibility of
   their social and cultural heritage and the representations associated
   with it in French society lead to discrimination which is more or less
   strong, coupled with a permanent questioning of their legitimacy to
   occupy positions of responsibility in the workplace … Through an
   analysis of identity experiences and discrimination of young adults of
   North African origin who grew up in France, Jean Beaman shows the
   duality, the complexity, and the situational nature of their
   belonging."—Anne-Laure Counilh, University of Poitiers
