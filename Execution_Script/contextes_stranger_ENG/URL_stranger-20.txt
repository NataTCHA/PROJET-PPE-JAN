Stranger Danger

Who is a Stranger?

     * A stranger is anyone you don't know.
     * Strangers can be men, women or teenagers.
     * If you have never met them before, they are strangers!
     * Although there are kind strangers, some strangers are not always
       kind and some can hurt you.
     * There is no way to tell if someone is good just by looking at them.
--
     * Don't be fooled! Just stay away.

When a Stranger tries to talk to you

     * Do not look at them or acknowledge that they have spoken to you,
--
     * Try not to walk anywhere alone. Walk with a friend or two.
     * Don't take shortcuts through the woods or empty lots.
     * Do not get close to strangers. Make sure you have room to run.
     * Don't tell your name or address to a stranger.
     * Know how and when to call 9-1-1.
     * Never open the door to a stranger.
     * Never tell anyone on the phone you are alone.
     * Never take candy, money or gifts from a stranger.
     * Never go with a stranger to help look for a lost pet or play a
       game.
     * Never get into a car with anyone you don't know.
     * If a stranger follows you or grabs for you, yell really loud.
       Shout, "I don't know you," so other people know you are in trouble.
       Fight back and make as much noise as you can.

       name or phone number on the phone, don't answer it.

Stranger Tricks

   Strangers who are bad people and want to hurt you have developed some
   pretty tricky things to do to confuse you and get you alone with them.
     * First, there is the "Help Trick". This is when a stranger asks you
       to help them find a lost pet or maybe asks you for directions to
       get somewhere.
     * The next trick is called the "Emergency Trick". A stranger will
       tell you that there is an emergency in your family and your mom or
       dad asked them to get you. The stranger may even say that your mom
       or dad got hurt.
     * Another trick strangers try is the "Accident Trick". This is when a
       stranger lays on the ground and looks like they have been injured,
       are unconscious, or in pain. Do not go over to the person! They can
       grab you and take you away. Instead, go to someone you know and
       tell them or call 911 for help.
     * The "Animal Trick" is another one that is hard to resist. This is
       when a stranger holds a small animal and invites you to pet it. You
       are close enough for this stranger to discard the animal and grab
       you.
     * The last is called the "Bribe Trick". This is when a stranger
       promises you candy, money or something else of interest. People do
       not give gifts to people they do not know.
