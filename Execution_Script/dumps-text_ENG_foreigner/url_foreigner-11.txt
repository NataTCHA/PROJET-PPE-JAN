   With the upcoming arrival of the Day of the Dead, a video where a
   foreigner stated that the bread of the dead was made from the real dead
   was once again a trend on the internet.

   The much loved and popular tradition of the Day of the Dead is
   approaching, a Mexican celebration that has the purpose of honoring
   those who have already left the earthly world, however, aspects of this
   celebration are still very unknown to many people.

   Such was the case of an American girl who assured that the bread of the
   dead is created from the ashes of Mexicans. Yes, that‚Äôs right.

   The video of said statement was originally shared in 2019 through
   the TikTok platform, unleashing laughter and criticism from thousands
   of users around the world, as well as quite a shock, because he really
   said those words with complete confidence.

   ‚Äú I did not know, but for people who are not from Mexico, did you know
   that they really put ashes of the dead on the bread of the dead? That
   is why it is called that. How strange is Mexico! ‚Äù, He indicated in the
   video, which you can see by clicking here.

   For this reason, just days after the Day of the Dead takes place, the
   video has again generated controversy, controversy and has unleashed
   hundreds of sarcastic reactions, for example, that under this logic,
   granny chocolate may be made of grannies and the pastor tacos de
   pastores.
