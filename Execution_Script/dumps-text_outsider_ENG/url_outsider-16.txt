The CEO of De Beers, Bruce Cleaver, will step down in 2023 to take up a
non-executive role, with outsider Al Cook named as his replacement. Cook is
currently vice-president of exploration international production for Equinor
ASA, a Norway-based energy company, and he will assume the helm at an
interesting time for the diamond industry.

   Unlike a diamond, being CEO of De Beers is not forever.

   Anglo American CEO Duncan Wanblad said in a statement that Cleaver had
   decided “to step back after six years to a non-executive role”. There
   had been speculation that Cleaver was in contention to replace former
   Anglo CEO Mark Cutifani, who retired in April.

   Cook cut his teeth at BP and then Equinor in an international energy
   career and Wanblad commented that his “… multidisciplinary strategic
   skill set and strong personal conviction and values are ideally suited
   to the nature of De Beers, a global business that spans much of the
   spectrum, from exploration and mining to Bond Street and Madison
   Avenue”.

   De Beers certainly does span a wide spectrum and these are interesting
   times for the global diamond industry. The traditional site auctions
   that De Beers perfected – in part to retain a tight grip on the trade –
   are being challenged by upstarts that are selling directly to
   manufacturers.

   Meanwhile, De Beers has set its sights on remote locations – such as
   the coast of Greenland – for exploration and is producing diamonds in
   the Canadian Arctic.

   waters | Reuters

   Under Cleaver, the company had returned to Angola after a 20-year
   absence and even began exploring again around Kimberley, where it all
   began in 1869.

   Cleaver also navigated De Beers through the choppy waters of the Covid
   pandemic.

   Producers are keenly aware of the “blood” or “conflict diamond” risk to
   their reputation and keeping stringent tabs on the sourcing of gems
   remains a priority.

   Among the tasks in Cook’s inbox will be the renewal of De Beers’
   marketing agreement for the production of rough diamonds from Botswana
   via Debswana, its joint venture with the government.

   “The Government of the Republic of Botswana and De Beers Group have
   extended their existing agreement for the sale of Debswana’s rough
   diamond production by 12 months until 30 June 2023. Following further
   positive progress towards a new agreement being made in the first half
   of 2022, the two parties have agreed to the one-year extension to
   enable the finalisation of the ongoing discussions,” De Beers said in
   June.

   So, the incoming CEO has a lot on his plate, and Anglo’s shareholders
   and other stakeholders will be expecting a polished performance. BM/DM

We would like our readers to start paying for Daily Maverick...

   …but we are not going to force you to. Over 10 million users come to us
   each month for the news. We have not put it behind a paywall because
   the truth should not be a luxury. Instead we ask our readers who can
   afford to contribute, even a small amount each month, to do so. How
   often do you read us? Is our journalism worth R6.57 a day to you? If it
   is, you will get R200 a month in Uber vouchers straight back and a host
   of other benefits.

   Join our Maverick Insider membership programme. If it is not for you,
   you can cancel anytime.

  A South African Hero: You

   There’s a 99.8% chance that this isn’t for you. Only 0.2% of our
   readers have responded to this call for action.

   Those 0.2% of our readers are our hidden heroes, who are fuelling our
   work and impacting the lives of every South African in doing so.
   They’re the people who contribute to keep Daily Maverick free for all,
   including you.

   We need so many more of our readers to join them. The equation is quite
   simple: the more members we have, the more reporting and investigations
   we can do, and the greater the impact on the country. We are inundated
   with tip-offs; we know where to look and what to do with the
   information when we have it – we just need the means to help us keep
   doing this work.

   Be part of that 0.2%. Be a Maverick. Be a Maverick Insider.
