Ordinance of the Ministry of Health – Inbound passengers from China to Italy

   [Coronavirus-COVID-19.jpg]


   29/12/2022

   With a view to identifying and limiting the spread of possible variants
   of the COVID-19 virus, from 28 December 2022 to 31 January 2023, the
   regulations laid down in the Ordinance of the Ministry of Health shall
   apply to all inbound passengers from China. The regulation sets out the
   following provisions:
    1. Before embarking, the obligation for passengers to submit to the
       carrier a certificate proving to have taken a molecular test during
       the 72 preceding hours or an antigen test during the preceding 48
       hours, with a negative test swab result;
    2. The obligation to take an antigen swab test on arrival at the
       airport or, should this be impossible, to take it at the competent
       local health authority within 48 hours from the passenger’s entry
       in the national territory;
    3. In case of testing positive to the antigen test, the obligation to
       immediately take a molecular test in order to enable the virus
       genome sequencing and a period of self-isolation in compliance with
       the current regulations;
    4. The obligation to test negative to another antigen or molecular
       test to end the self-isolation period.

   As long as free from COVID-19 symptoms, the above provisions do not
   apply to children under six, the members of the crew and on-board staff
   on the means of transport of passengers and goods, the officials and
   officers, however defined, of the European Union or of international
   organizations, diplomats, the administrative and technical staff of
   diplomatic missions, the officials and employees of Consulates, the
   military personnel, including those re-entering the Country from
   international missions, the Police Forces, the staff of the Information
   System for the Security of the Republic (Sistema di informazione per la
   sicurezza della Repubblica) and of the Fire Department in the exercise
   of their duties.
