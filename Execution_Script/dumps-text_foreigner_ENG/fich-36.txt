Being a Foreigner While Abroad

   A Brandeis student in South Africa

   You may encounter both negative and positive stereotypes regarding your
   ethnicity and/or nationality while abroad, and we encourage you to do
   some research to learn a bit more about what it means to be a foreigner
   living and studying in another country.

   Some examples of things you may want to consider are:
     * Politeness: Formal greetings and grammar may be more common. You
       may also find that you receive more personal questions as others
       may be more curious about you. Remember that just because something
       seems impolite to you, it might not actually be impolite within
       your new culture.
     * Speech: Humor and profanity may be perceived differently in a new
       culture and language.
     * Dress: Appropriate clothing varies around the world. Learn about
       the cultural and/or religious background of your new community. Ask
       questions to understand the history behind certain differences in
       dress and do your best to be respectful of those differences.
     * Physical contact: Take special note of social and personal space.
       Different cultures have different ways of saying hello and goodbye
       and different standards of how much physical contact is considered
       appropriate. Also, be observant of the different stages of a
       relationship and the amount of physical contact associated with
       them while you are abroad. A simple pat on the back or a hug could
       prove very uncomfortable for the receiver if the context is
       inappropriate. Read more.
     * Drinking and drunkenness: Be aware of local laws and customs around
       drinking. While in many countries social drinking is common,
       drunkenness is rarely viewed as amusing and in most cases is seen
       as intolerable and insulting.
     * Classroom behavior: Expect your classroom environment to be
       different than here at Brandeis. For example, participating in
       class may not be appropriate, the use of technology may be
       discouraged, classes may be organized differently, and learning may
       take place in new formats.
     * Your identity: Studying abroad may be your first time being a
       minority or being part of the majority in your new country or even
       within your program cohort. Identities around race, religion,
       gender presentation, socioeconomic class, and more, can all play a
       large role in your experience. You may find that others ask you
       more questions or you may find that you ask yourself more questions
       around your identity. Before going abroad, think about what some of
       these questions might be and how you might react to them.
