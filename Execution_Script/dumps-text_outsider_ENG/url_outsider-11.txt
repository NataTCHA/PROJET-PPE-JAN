College campuses, students and outsiders: three’s a crowd

Often canvassing support for one political outfit or the other ahead of PU’s

   As campus politics heat up in the run up to the Panjab University
   Campus Student Council (PUCSC) polls, chances of one running into an
   outsider on the college campuses across the city have also shot up.

   Often canvassing support for one political outfit or the other, they
   have become a bit of an eyesore for the students and the college
   authorities.

   Even on Tuesday, which was a holiday to mark Guru Ramdas’ birth
   anniversary, the DAV campus in Sector 10 was still lively, with members
   of various political parties dotting the entrance gate. While the
   Sector 3 police station has set up a checkpoint right opposite the
   entrance, rashly-driven jeeps with party stickers could be seen
   speeding by at regular intervals.

   Police officials said only students living in hostels were allowed
   inside the campus. On the other side of the gates, a student says he
   had gotten accustomed, but not entirely comfortable, to the sight of
   crowds, the speeding cars, the odd fights and arguments that break.

   At Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma College, Sector 32, outsiders
   have also disrupted normalcy. Chirag Batra and Nikhil Bansal, both
   enrolled at the college, say many students feel that outsiders are
   crowding the campus even as the outfits based out of their own college
   are treated unfairly.

   “College authorities misbehaved with the college’s own parties. A
   recent three-hour protest to disallow outsiders from campus saw several
   students not involved in politics participate. Student elections do not
   bring around a lot of change, and we don’t want to see brawls and
   violence on our campus,” the duo added.

   Indian National Students Organisation (INSO) leader from DAV-10,
   Aashish Phogat says authorities need to toughen up the act against
   outsiders, “While checking ID proof at the entrance is a must, in case
   there is any suspicion there is a server room right besides the gate
   where the roll number of a student can be checked to verify the
   identity.”

   Presidential candidate at the SD college representing the Sanatan
   Dharam College Union and Sanatan Dharam Hostel Union, Ritik Shukla,
   echoes the sentiment, saying, “While the college’s own party faces the
   authorities’ ire, parties which bring on members from Panjab University
   are given a free hand at roaming around the campus.”

   In the face of chaos, authorities have been forced to get extra help
   with crowd control. DAV-10 principal Pawan Sharma says, “We have hired
   four bouncers for the election period. Nobody is allowed to enter the
   campus without photo ID proof as we have had problems with outsiders
   instigating the students in the past.”

   The problems are more complex for all-girls colleges. Principal of the
   girls’ college in Sector 42, Nisha Aggarwal said, “From Wednesday,
   entry for outsiders had been strictly banned. Boys especially are not
   allowed inside the campus, and the students must carry their ID cards
   with them to enter.”

   Another city college principal, not wishing to be named, meanwhile,
   offered a quick reminder that while college authorities are trying
   their best to keep a check on outsiders, the UT administration must
   chip in with support to help keep campuses conducive for its students.
