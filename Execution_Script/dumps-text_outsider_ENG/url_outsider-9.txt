Meet The Anti-Corruption Outsider Who Could Be Nigeria’s Next President

Peter Obi, a man who carries his own suitcases, could be Nigeria’s next
president, The Economist reports.

   An interview with an outsider who says he will actually do something
   about corruption.

   “This is a case of Goliath and David,” says Peter Obi, a long-shot
   candidate who has unexpectedly taken the lead in the race to become
   president of Africa’s most populous country and its biggest economy.
   “The big people are there, but allow this small person to do it. And I
   know I can do it.”

   As public campaigning was about to begin in late September, Nigeria was
   rocked by the release of three polls showing Mr Obi well ahead of the
   two candidates representing the main parties that have mis-ruled
   Nigeria since the restoration of its democracy in 1999. In two of the
   polls Mr Obi has a lead of more than 15 percentage points over Bola
   Tinubu, of the incumbent All Progressives Congress (apc), and Atiku
   Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (pdp), the main opposition.
   What makes this even more extraordinary is that Mr Obi is standing for
   the Labour Party, whose candidate at the previous presidential election
   in 2019 won just 5,074 votes out of 28m cast.

   Mr Obi’s sudden ascent represents a rare chance for Nigeria. The
   country ought to be rich: it has huge reserves of oil, gas and other
   minerals, plenty of fertile land and a young population of go-getters.
   Yet Nigerians are poorer today than they were ten years ago and 40% of
   them survive on less than $1.90 a day.

   The reasons why Nigeria is poor are rotten politics, bad governance and
   corruption. Politicians in Nigeria have long stirred up ethnic and
   religious divisions by promising to direct state resources to members
   of their own group. Once in power they have pursued contorted economic
   policies such as a fixed exchange rate and massive fuel subsidies. Some
   policies seem to make sense only as a way of allowing cronies to siphon
   off cash.

   Neither of the two main candidates contesting the presidential election
   scheduled for February offers much hope for change. Mr Abubakar, a
   former customs official turned tycoon, was accused alongside his wife
   in 2010 by a US Senate committee report of being linked to the transfer
   of $40m in “suspect funds” to America. (He denies wrongdoing.) Mr
   Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state, had his assets frozen in the
   1990s by the American government, which alleged it had probable cause
   to believe the money was linked to drugs. Mr Tinubu, who has also
   denied wrongdoing, reached a settlement with the American government
   whereby he agreed to forfeit $460,000.

   There are, of course, no guarantees that Mr Obi would break the
   kleptocracy that is throttling Nigeria: the country’s political system
   has a habit of corrupting even those who start out with the best of
   intentions. But if he were to sustain his lead until the election in
   February, he would be the first politician in decades to show that a
   new sort of politics is possible in Nigeria. If he is able to keep
   energising young, urban voters across the country’s main divides of
   religion, geography and ethnicity, he may well redraw Nigeria’s
   electoral map. And by making this election about competence, character
   and perhaps even ideas, Mr Obi promises to upend the old electoral
   calculus, which was based on horse-trading to form majorities between
   politicians who gathered votes mainly among their coreligionists or
   ethnic groups.

   In many ways, Mr Obi seems an unlikely revolutionary. He is rich, like
   many of Nigeria’s political elite. (Unlike many other wealthy Nigerian
   politicians, Mr Obi seems to have made his money before taking office
   or working for the government.) He is also no political outsider,
   having served two terms as governor of Anambra state until 2014 and
   then standing as Mr Abubakar’s vice-presidential candidate in 2019.

   Here the similarities end. As an energetic 61-year-old Mr Obi stands in
   sharp contrast to the 75-year-old Mr Abubakar and to Mr Tinubu, who
   though just a decade older was recently forced to respond to widespread
   rumours of ill health by posting a video of himself pedalling an
   exercise bicycle on Twitter, saying: “Many have said I have died;
   others claim I have withdrawn from the presidential campaign. Well…
   Nope.” Mr Obi, on the other hand, has a vigorous social-media operation
   with a vast, passionate following, and is strikingly open to
   interviews.

   Mr Obi’s surging popularity is due, above all, to perceptions of his
   character. In a country cursed by politicians of extraordinary ego and
   entourage, his supporters marvel that as governor Mr Obi queued at
   airports holding his own luggage. He also slashed the size of his
   motorcade when he found that 13 of the cars were empty, he says. This
   not only plays well with young voters, but also annoys his rivals.
   Kashim Shettima, Mr Tinubu’s running-mate, grumbles that Mr Obi “tends
   to glamorise poverty” by claiming to own only one watch. (Mr Shettima,
   who likes smart watches, says he “has more than two or three”.)

   Frugality is relative in Nigerian politics. The Economist interviewed
   Mr Obi in his suite in the most plush hotel in Abuja, the capital (it
   is also one of the most secure), though at least Mr Obi was free of the
   hordes of hangers-on who typically surround Nigerian bigwigs. His
   running-mate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, is also far from poor.

   When asked what distinguishes him most from the other two major
   candidates Mr Obi replies: “Who can people trust?” He promises to
   deliver and not to steal. Yet he too has faced some questions over his
   financial affairs. The Pandora Papers, a large set of leaks to the
   press of records from financial companies, revealed that Mr Obi owned
   an undeclared offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, a tax
   haven. He also reportedly failed to declare all his assets or
   immediately relinquish control of all his companies, as required by the
   law, upon becoming governor. Mr Obi claimed at the time that he did not
   know he had to declare assets held jointly with his family and that he
   did relinquish control of the company in question, but that an error
   meant it was not enacted for 14 months.

   To try to show that the money in those companies was earned before he
   entered politics, Mr Obi pulls out stacks of letters from his bank in
   London showing the scale of his lines of business credit in the 1990s.
   In any case, he argues, his rivals are very rich, too. “What is their
   source of wealth?” he asks. Context matters. “Relative to the field…he
   is a saint, more or less,” says Ebenezer Obadare of the Council on
   Foreign Relations, a think-tank New York. Though that does not
   necessarily make him “clean”, he adds.

   Mr Obi also wants to run on competence. He emphasises that he left a
   fiscal surplus to his successor as governor⁠—a rarity. Anambra’s score
   on the Human Development Index, a measure of income, education and life
   expectancy, was falling when Mr Obi entered office in 2006. It bottomed
   out by 2008, with Anambra ranked eighth among Nigeria’s states. By the
   time he left office in 2014, Anambra had leapt to third place, trailing
   only the capital and Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. Between 2006
   and 2012, Onitsha, the biggest city in the state, was in the top 50 of
   750 cities worldwide for the rate of private-sector job growth,
   according to the World Bank.

   Mr Obi is disappointingly less keen to emphasise his proposed policies
   as president. “We’re all going to come up with the same products but
   which of these brands will you trust?” he says. Still, improving
   security is his “number one priority”. It ought to be. Over the past
   eight years under President Muhammadu Buhari, jihadist terrorists have
   terrorised Nigeria’s north-east. Violence in the south-east, often
   attributed to Igbo separatists, has surged, as has crime. Gangs known
   locally as bandits killed 2,600 people last year.

   To restore order Mr Obi promises to expand the security forces and
   equip them better. Structurally he proposes giving states and local
   governments the power to have their own police officers, rather than
   rely solely on federal forces. He is also willing to talk to armed
   groups that have political demands such as the Indigenous People of
   Biafra, a separatist group in his own south-eastern region.

   When it comes to the economy, his instincts appear liberal. “There is a
   lot of government involved where the private sector should be,” he
   says. Nigeria’s petrol subsidies will eat up more than federal spending
   on health, education and welfare combined. Mr Obi promises to get rid
   of these handouts: “Fifty per cent of it is corruption, you deal with
   it immediately.” The rest could take three or six months, he says. Yet
   the Labour Party has close ties with unions, many of which have
   repeatedly opposed subsidy reform. “I’m not going to make promises I’m
   not going to fulfil,” he insists. When it comes to the currency Mr
   Obi’s liberalism wears thin. He is not in favour of letting the naira
   float freely, though he says he would allow the official rate to move
   closer to the black-market one.

   Frugality also shapes his attitude to debt. “We want to borrow strictly
   for investment, if need be—if at all!” he says, criticising Nigeria’s
   rising debts to China. Yet thrift alone is unlikely to solve Nigeria’s
   problems. Federal government spending is just 6% of gdp. Even with more
   efficient spending, there will not be enough cash to tackle Nigeria’s
   enormous infrastructure needs. Increasing Nigeria’s paltry tax take is
   crucial, but goes largely unmentioned by Mr Obi.

   Can Mr Obi pull it off? His supporters think so. “I am an Obi-dient
   man,” laughs Kingsley Onwe, a trader selling tomato paste at a street
   market outside Abuja. Mr Onwe is not advertising general deference to
   authority. “Obi-dients” is the nickname for Mr Obi’s supporters. His
   rivals are, however, dismissive. “We’re not bothered about him,” says
   Dino Melaye, Mr Abubakar’s campaign spokesman. The vituperative attack
   that the former senator launches suggests otherwise. In his telling, Mr
   Obi is a “deceptive character” who has a “plethora of allegations
   against him”. For good measure he adds that Mr Obi “knows himself that
   he cannot win it but he sees it as an avenue to make money.” Should
   your correspondent want to talk more about running for office to make
   money, Mr Melaye (who enjoys posing with his collection of Ferraris and
   Lamborghinis) leaves his business card: a metallic-gold one that looks
   like a credit card.

   Even if the polls are accurate—the large share of undecided voters
   suggests the outcome is still in flux—Mr Obi will still have to clear
   several hurdles on the path to becoming president. The first relates to
   the rules. In order to avoid a run-off, the winning candidate must not
   only have the most votes. They must also get more than 25% in each of
   at least two-thirds of the country’s 36 states and capital territory.
   Doing so, admits Mr Baba-Ahmed, may be challenging, particularly in ten
   northern states that have tended to swing for northern and Muslim
   candidates whereas Mr Obi is a Christian from the south.

   Mr Shettima, the ruling party’s vice-presidential candidate, is also
   dismissive of Mr Obi’s chances in the north. The former governor of the
   northern state of Borno, suggests asking northerners about Mr Obi,
   saying they will think “he is either a musician or a footballer”. From
   doing just that it is clear that Mr Shettima is exaggerating. On the
   streets of Kano, the biggest city in the north, enormous billboards of
   Mr Tinubu and Mr Abubakar loom large. Mr Obi’s image is all but absent
   and at his Kano headquarters a broken billboard was leaning against a
   fence. No one but a toothy guard was present. Despite this, some polls
   show him running second in the north.

   Even so, Kano illustrates a second risk to Mr Obi’s campaign. The
   Labour Party he represents will not have candidates on dozens of
   ballots for seats in the Senate and 130 seats in the House of
   Representatives. This means it will have to convince voters to break
   with habit and cast their votes “skirt and blouse” (backing one party
   for president and another for the other races). Moreover, the party has
   few members, no state governors and just one senator. Usually governors
   and senators help funnel cash (both legitimately donated and less so)
   to campaigns and rustle up the tens of thousands of party lackeys who
   go out to persuade, bully or bribe people to vote for their parties
   candidate.

   Mr Melaye of the PDP explains with disarming frankness why these
   structures matter. “In every catchment area you have people who are the
   owners of the voters,” he says, without blushing. Mr Baba-Ahmed gamely
   puts a brave face on the Labour Party’s weakness, saying that it will
   allow him and Mr Obi to govern cleanly because they will not be
   beholden to bigwigs. That may be so, but they have to win first.

   In a bid to do so, Mr Obi is trying to tackle vote-buying head on. “I
   tell people every day, the money people are sharing is just stolen
   money, it is not their money,” he says, “That’s why people are dying in
   hospitals. That’s why there are no roads.” This election will be a test
   of whether the old way of doing politics has been superseded by one
   based on individual choice and direct appeals to the public.

   The third risk to Mr Obi’s campaign is outright rigging. Mr Obi himself
   plays down such fears. Recent reforms to the vote-counting process
   should make ballot-stuffing harder this time. Yet Mr Baba-Ahmed is “not
   confident” the vote will be free and fair. Some activists share these
   concerns. Ayisha Osori of the Open Society Foundations, an advocacy and
   philanthropy group, thinks the ruling apc will try to depress turnout
   in areas where Mr Obi is strong. Doing so could spark conflict. “If
   they decide to humiliate [Obi] and have a blatantly rigged, violent
   election, I’m really worried about what people will do,” she says. Mr
   Obi himself brushes off the idea his supporters might react angrily to
   a defeat. He is simply focused on winning. “I’m saying I’m better, I’m
   saying I can do it better,” he insists. “Trust me.” Right now at least,
   many do.
