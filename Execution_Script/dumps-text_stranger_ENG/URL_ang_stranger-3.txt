The America that progressives have given us is stranger than fiction

   Sometimes I think I’m watching a Fellini movie, one of those really
   strange ones where I witness something so bizarre that I think I’m
   hallucinating — except it turns out to be real.

   So, was I hallucinating when I heard there were more than two genders,
   more than boys and girls, men and women, male and female — and that men
   could get pregnant?

   You tell me. At a congressional hearing, when asked, “Can biological
   men become pregnant and give birth?” a doctor from Planned Parenthood
   said, “Men can have pregnancies. … Somebody with a uterus may have the
   capability of becoming pregnant, whether they’re a woman or a man.”

   While you’re scratching your head over that, let’s move down to our
   southern border, the one Vice President Kamala Harris assures us is
   “secure.” But on television I see thousands of illegal immigrants
   walking into the United States every day — more than 2 million a year,
   according to official records.

   Maybe Harris is right and my eyes are wrong. Maybe I’m hallucinating
   and not really seeing what I think I’m seeing.

   What about the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan — you know, the chaotic
   mess that President Biden called a “success”?

   Wasn’t that the withdrawal that was marred by a terrorist attack that
   killed more than 180 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members? And didn’t we
   leave behind tens of billions of dollars in military equipment that
   fell into the hands of the Taliban?

   Good thing it was a “success,” right? Or maybe I’m just imagining all
   the bad stuff.  Hallucinations will do that.

   Here’s more good news: “The pandemic is over.” I know that because
   President Biden — the same president who said the withdrawal from
   Afghanistan was a success — has told us it’s over.

   But if it’s really “over” why are between 400 and 500 Americans still
   dying every day of COVID-19? Somebody must be hallucinating because the
   president of the United States says “the pandemic is over.”

   But wait. If it’s really over, why is the Biden administration
   “forgiving” up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for certain
   borrowers to make sure they are “not placed in a worse position
   financially because of the pandemic” — you know, the one that’s “over”?

   I’m not sure if I’m simply confused or if I’m still hallucinating —
   because I thought crime in our big cities was a real problem. But you’d
   be hard-pressed to find a progressive district attorney anywhere in the
   United States who thinks crime is a big deal, or at least will say so
   publicly. Or, as The Atlantic magazine put it, “Refusing to admit the
   gravity of the [crime] problem won’t make it go away.”

   The real impact of Trumpism Are special envoys getting special
   treatment from Congress?

   Even Federico Fellini might think he was watching one of his own
   strange movies if he were alive and witnessing what passes for reality
   in the United States, circa 2022. And why wouldn’t he? After all, we’re
   told that the bloody U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is a “success.”
   We’re assured that even though the coronavirus is killing hundreds of
   Americans every day, “the pandemic is over.” We know that millions of
   illegal immigrants enter the United States in a single year but we’re
   supposed to believe that the border is “secure.” Statistics tell us
   crime is on the rise but progressives believe it isn’t. And, of course,
   men can get pregnant.

   Yes, up is down, east is west, day is night, and mostly, lies are
   truth. Fellini may have been a master at mixing fantasy with reality,
   but what’s going on today in the United States, I suspect, would be too
   bizarre, even for him.
