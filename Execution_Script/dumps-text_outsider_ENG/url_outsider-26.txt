   Summary.

   Coco Chanel, Steve Jobs, and Katalin Karikó were outsiders who defied
   the odds and produced revolutionary innovations. How do such outsiders
   succeed when so many others fail? The authors’ research uncovered four
   factors: (1) The outsiders were not outliers; they belonged to the
   system but hadn’t lost touch with its fringes. (2) An outsider had at
   least one insider who was willing to vouch for his or her ideas or
   abilities. (3) Outsiders leveraged “fracture points” — such as the
   death of a major gatekeeper. (4) Instead of just viewing their
   innovation as a technical challenge, they see it as a marketing
   challenge.

   Every once in a while, an outsider comes along with a new vision or a
   new way of doing things that revolutionizes a scientific field, an
   industry, or a culture. Take the case of Katalin Karikó, who defied all
   odds to pioneer the mRNA technology that ultimately gave the world
   Covid-19 vaccines in record time. Daughter of a butcher and raised in a
   small adobe house in the former Eastern bloc with no running water or
   refrigerator, Karikó started working with RNA as a student in Hungary
   but moved to the United States in her late twenties. For decades, she
   faced rejection after rejection, the scorn of colleagues, and even the
   threat of deportation. Yet today, Karikó’s foundational work on mRNA is
   at the heart of the vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna,
   and many researchers are now calling for Karikó to win the Nobel Prize.

   How did that happen? After 10 years of research, relying on a mix of
   qualitative techniques, large dataset analysis, and historical
   research, we have come up with four factors that explain the success of
   outsiders like Karikó. These factors do not have to be concomitant, and
   none is necessary, but each increases the odds substantially that an
   outsider will break through and their innovation will have a major
   impact.

1. Outsiders are not outliers.

   Our research suggests that successes like Karikó’s occur not just
   despite outsider status but because of it. Being less tied to the norms
   and standards to which insiders conform, outsiders recognize solutions
   that escape incumbents’ attention. Yet, the paradox is that the same
   social position that gives outsiders the perspective to pursue
   imaginative projects also constrains their ability to obtain support
   and recognition for their innovations. How do the innovations of
   outsiders like Karikó gain traction?

   The innovation pattern we observed in our research is very consistent.
   Outsiders typically innovate by acting on insights and experiences that
   are new to the context they enter but familiar to the context they come
   from. Consider Coco Chanel, the illegitimate daughter of a laundress
   and a street peddler. Abandoned and raised by nuns in an orphanage, she
   found in this humble context original inspiration for some of her most
   iconic design concepts. For example, her proverbial predilection for
   black and white is generally attributed to her prolonged exposure to
   the colors of the orphanage uniforms and the nuns’ tunics. Even the
   distinctive Chanel logo was an idea she gleaned from a simple
   stained-glass window of her orphanage, the Abbey of Aubazine.

   You would think that successful outsiders like Karikó and Chanel are
   statistical outliers, but we find this is not actually the case: In one
   of our studies, we analyzed the network of collaborations of
   approximately 12,000 Hollywood professionals to explore whether
   creative success is concentrated at the center of the system or at its
   margins. What we found surprised us: The most successful artists were
   not those at the extreme periphery of the network, the “renegades from
   the human race” — to borrow a label famously coined by Don Valentine,
   the pioneering venture capitalist who created Sequoia Capital, to
   describe Steve Jobs, when he first met him in the late 1970s. But
   neither were they “network kings” at the heart of their industry. The
   outsiders were not outliers: This study showed that the probability of
   creative success was highest in a border zone between the center and
   the periphery, by artists who belong to the system but have not lost
   touch with its fringes.

   Access to the center provides legitimacy while exposure to the fringe
   provides novelty. The combination of legitimacy and novelty produces
   impact. Statistically, the people most likely to succeed were those who
   kept one foot in Hollywood (where they could leverage resources,
   connections, and legitimacy) and the other foot on the edge (where they
   would encounter unfamiliar people, places, and habits).

2. Behind every Steve Jobs is a Mike Markkula, a champion on the inside.

   Thinking like an outsider can have advantages, but practicing the way
   of the outsider is complicated. Outsiders are strangers. They do not
   hold élite positions, and they have limited resources and lack the
   credentials of better-connected people whose theories or practices they
   are challenging. Not surprisingly, they often stay locked outside.

   Our research suggests that the outsider needs at least one insider who
   is willing to vouch for their ideas or abilities. In collaboration with
   Paul Allison, a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania
   Sociology, we went back to our Hollywood network and gathered new data
   on thousands of awards bestowed by two crucial audiences in this
   industry: critics and peers. Our statistical analyses revealed that
   critics were more likely to praise peripheral artists than insiders.
   Conversely, industry peers are more likely to favor their fellow
   insiders. From the outsider’s perspective, this means that one
   effective strategy to gain traction is to identify an audience — a
   person or a group of people — that has a cognitive or emotional
   affinity for the outsider or their ideas (as well as the credibility
   that the outsider usually lacks).

   Steve Jobs’s early career is a case in point. The VC industry
   repeatedly refused to support his project, but Jobs kept searching for
   a receptive audience. Finally, he met Mike Markkula, a wealthy young
   engineer who saw potential where the VC establishment saw only
   roadblocks. He made the first investment in Apple Computer. Why did
   Markkula support Jobs? Because his passion for technology and
   relatively young age gave him a stronger affinity with Jobs and his
   partner Steve Wozniak than most members of Silicon Valley’s investment
   community had. And with Markkula behind him, Jobs had the credibility
   he needed to attract more talent and money.

3. “Fracture points” let outsiders in.

   A third way outsiders break in is by leveraging what we call “fracture
   points” — events that generate intense stress on the system. One
   particular class of fracture points that we have been investigating
   reflects Max Planck’s famous quip that “an important scientific
   innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and
   converting its opponents: It rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul.
   What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out.” The idea is
   simple: When the gatekeepers die, they create space for the entrance of
   the new.

   In music, for instance, such moments happen after the death of a major
   artist. Working with Simone Santoni of City University of London, we
   assembled one of the world’s largest databases of musicians, songs, and
   music awards, as well as sudden deaths of superstars such as Michael
   Jackson or Prince. Regardless of the genre, in the years in which the
   system suffered a fracture point, the probability that a peripheral
   artist won a Grammy award increased by almost 40% while the chance that
   a central artist got it went down by 24%. The winning artist’s work
   also tended to be atypical in style compared to that of a more ordinary
   year.

4. Disruption is a marketing challenge that can be overcome.

   After being rejected by every major journal, Karikó’s breakthrough
   research was finally published in 2005. For years, however, it still
   got little attention. “We talked to pharmaceutical companies and
   venture capitalists. No one cared,” her research partner, Drew
   Weissman, recalled.

   Most established organizations and industries tend to reproduce the
   power and privilege structure of incumbent groups, reducing outsiders’
   chances of making their ideas heard and proving their worth. But our
   research suggests that outsiders should not be daunted: The very traits
   that make outsiders so disadvantaged within established occupational
   structures and professional categories are often precisely those
   required for the pursuit of exceptional entrepreneurial achievements in
   art, science, and business.

   Often, extraordinary outsiders’ primary problem is not their ideas but
   selling those ideas, precisely because of their disruptive
   implications. As the late Clayton Christensen noted in his 1997 book
   The Innovator’s Dilemma, “disruptive technology should be framed as a
   marketing challenge, not a technological one.”
