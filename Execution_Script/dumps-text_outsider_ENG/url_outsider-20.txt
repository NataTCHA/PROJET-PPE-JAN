Vampires Are Taking Over Pop Culture Again—But This Time, the Monster Is Us

   A decade after Twilight mania, bloodsuckers are back in the pop-culture
   spotlight—and more human than ever (Robert Hickerson for TIME)
   A decade after Twilight mania, bloodsuckers are back in the pop-culture
   spotlight—and more human than ever

   Reginald Andres is not like other vampires. Sure, he has a pair of
   retractable fangs, subsists on blood, and sizzles in the sun. Yet the
   hero of Syfy horror comedy Reginald the Vampire, played by Jacob
   Batalon, is also timid and geeky and self-conscious about his round
   belly. It doesn’t help that the vampire community is more superficial
   than a nest of high school mean girls.

   Listen, not every bloodsucker is a supermodel—just ask cinema’s
   ur-vampire Nosferatu. But if the past century of film and TV are any
   indication, then they’ve yet to receive the body-positivity memo.
   Adapted from Johnny B. Truant’s comic Fat Vampire, the silly but sweet
   Reginald plays with the trope of the svelte, impossibly attractive
   vampire. Instead of sinking his teeth into swooning humans, Reginald
   nurses a crush on a co-worker. Instead of lying around some mansion
   decorated in velvet and brocade, he slings slushies at a fast-food
   joint.

   Roughly a decade after the last, Twilight-driven wave of vampire media
   subsided, Dracula’s children are once again becoming pop culture’s
   monster of choice. And this time, they’re more than just objects of
   inchoate lust. While the fang-enhanced characters that populate new
   movies like Morbius, books like Claire Kohda’s Woman, Eating, and a
   particular glut of TV shows, from What We Do in the Shadows to Anne
   Rice’s Interview with the Vampire, are not all nebbishes like Reginald,
   they do seem more human than ever. Neither dastardly nor debonair,
   these undead creatures hang out with roommates, squabble with parents,
   suffer from chronic illnesses, and even experience discrimination based
   on differences they can’t control. Vampires—they’re just like us!
   (Except, of course, that we’re still their prey.)

   Vampires have always stood in for outsiders deemed exotic and
   dangerous, hiding in plain sight. Emerging into a fearful, fragmented
   society, however, at a time when binaries like insider-outsider,
   oppressor-oppressed, and us-them have never felt more subjective, these
   new vampire narratives blur the line separating mortal souls from
   allegedly soulless immortals. Not only is monstrousness in the eye of
   the beholder, but those of us who have reflections might be just as
   likely to find it in the mirror as we are to catch it tapping on our
   window.

   It’s no coincidence that the quintessential vampire story, Bram
   Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula, begins with an Englishman’s journey east
   to Transylvania in order to help a local nobleman, one Count Dracula,
   relocate to the UK. Embedded in their dynamic is the terror of
   concealed difference that is the psychological hallmark of vampire
   lore—in this case, the idea that a wealthy, influential foreigner might
   look like “one of us” but mean “us” harm.

   The fact that vampire lore dates back to antiquity, when it surfaced in
   several discrete, Eastern and Western cultures—and, as recently a few
   centuries ago, fueled outbreaks of mass hysteria on both sides of the
   Atlantic—underscores how entrenched most civilizations’ fear of the
   other has always been. In the 20th century West, where “one of us”
   meant white, straight, and Christian, vampires could stand in for
   light-skinned immigrants, Jews, queer people, political dissidents, and
   any other supposed outsider who could conceivably blend into a crowd.

   As countercultures exploded and progressive movements brought
   marginalized voices to the forefront, the allegories shifted. In the
   1960s and ’70s, vampires often represented the simultaneous thrills and
   perils of free love. Around the turn of the millennium, our
   culture-wide infatuation with the unknown yielded a flood of
   human-vampire romance franchises: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Twilight,
   The Vampire Diaries, The Southern Vampire Mysteries book series and its
   HBO adaptation, True Blood. Before it devolved into a mess of heaving
   bosoms and mixed metaphors, True Blood drew parallels between vampires
   “mainstreaming,” or living openly alongside humans, thanks to the
   invention of synthetic blood, and queer people integrating into
   straight society—complete with radicals who’d rather get staked than
   conform.

   Yet even as mortal heroines embraced their bloodsucker paramours,
   storytellers held them at arm’s length. The protagonists they created
   were almost always human, and brooding vamps like Twilight’s Edward
   Cullen and Buffy’s Angel maintained an unknowable mystique.

   The new generation of vampires is anything but cryptic. Just as
   Reginald vents anxieties to his maker (Mandela Van Peebles), the Staten
   Island roommates in FX’s hilarious Shadows—a vanguard of the vampire
   comeback, after four seasons—eagerly unload petty grievances on a
   documentary crew. Netflix’s First Kill, which debuted in June and was
   quickly canceled, to the outrage of fans, is narrated in part by
   teenage Juliette (Sarah Catherine Hook), whose immortal family won’t
   stop pressuring her to complete a daunting rite of passage:
   slaughtering her first victim. This unique problem activates universal
   adolescent angst. “Even on good days, I still feel like I don’t fit
   in,” Juliette laments. “Like everyone has it all figured out—the
   clothes they wear, the bands they like, who they are, who they wanna
   be. And I’m the only one stuck pretending.”

   These days, the typical coming-of-age vampire story is less a human’s
   fantasy of first love than it is a monster’s own bildungsroman.
   Peacock’s teen drama Vampire Academy, an adaptation of the Twilight-era
   YA books by Richelle Mead, takes place at a prep school for vampires,
   where students chafe against class divisions and struggle to live up to
   family legacies. Showtime’s disappointing Let the Right One In,
   premiering Oct. 7, twists the Swedish novel turned big-screen horror
   masterpiece into a gritty, New York crime drama. Among the only
   elements the show shares with the movie is a friendship between a
   vampire trapped in an eternally preadolescent body, Eleanor (Madison
   Taylor Baez), and her next-door neighbor, Isaiah (Ian Foreman), a
   gentle, bullied middle schooler. Eleanor’s predicament echoes that of
   Claudia in the new AMC drama Anne Rice’s Interview With the Vampire.
   Made immortal at 14, Claudia matures mentally but not physically—which
   sets her up for a long lifetime of choosing between loneliness and
   partners perversely attracted to her unnaturally childish appearance.

   Framed as a more honest follow-up to vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac’s
   (Jacob Anderson) confession to a naive young reporter in Rice’s novel
   and the 1994 film, this Interview casts Eric Bogosian as the same
   journalist half a century later. Rather than reverting to innuendo, the
   show makes plain—and explicit—the sexual relationship between Louis and
   his male maker, Lestat (Sam Reid). Because Louis is also Black, in
   1910s New Orleans, becoming immortal makes him a triply misunderstood
   outsider. He’s not the only queer vampire pouring their heart out, so
   to speak, to a human audience this year. When First Kill’s Juliette
   develops a crush on a classmate (Imani Lewis) she doesn’t know is a
   slayer, the attraction could turn fatal for either girl. The bookish
   first-person narrator of Isaac Fellman’s 2022 novel Dead Collections is
   Sol, a transgender man who works as an archivist. “I didn’t see myself
   as being in the closet about my illness, my vampirism,” he recalls,
   “but I’d only ever told my boss and HR.”

   Shadows</i> (John P Johnson—FX)

   Sol is one of many recent characters, from Right One’s Eleanor to
   Morbius’ eponymous Marvel antihero, whose thirst for blood is tied to a
   humanizing medical condition rather than an evil nature. More unusual
   is Sol’s resemblance to Fellman, who is also a trans man and an
   archivist; to at least some extent, Collections is a work of vampire
   autofiction. It makes sense that LGBTQ creators are reclaiming an
   archetype—monster—that has so often been deployed against them as a
   slur. As author Carmen Maria Machado notes in Shudder docuseries Queer
   for Fear, “If you’ve been on the other side of the pitchfork, you’re
   maybe a little sympathetic to the monster.”

   It also makes sense that outsider perspectives are supplanting those of
   the in-group, even within a niche as fantastical as vampire fiction, in
   a country where racial minorities will soon be the majority and the
   number of Americans who identify as queer or trans is steadily rising.
   The arts have trended towards diversity—or at least towards an expanded
   understanding that diverse representation might be desirable—since
   Buffy, which was celebrated in its time as a paragon of pop feminism,
   hired an all-white cast of vamps and slayers. Meanwhile, subversive
   movies like Raw and particularly Get Out have ushered in an age of
   socially progressive horror.

   But there’s more to the relatable-vampire phenomenon than a convergence
   of demographic and industry trends. On an emotional level, it resonates
   within a culture that turns disagreement into demonization. In the
   post-Trump era, the sweetest-looking Middle American mom might be an
   insurrectionist. Whether it’s a neighbor, a cab driver, or that cousin
   you had to unfriend on Facebook, any normal-seeming acquaintance is
   liable to start spewing venom that burns you to your core. It’s a bit
   like watching fangs suddenly descend from a friendly smile.

   Of course, to the insurrectionists, the rest of us (or our nonexistent
   globalist puppet masters, I guess), even those who don’t fit into any
   traditional outsider category, are the monsters. Polarized reactions to
   the pandemic have furthered the horror metaphor; what’s scarier than an
   unmasked, unvaccinated visitor coughing SARS-CoV-2 all over a nursing
   home? As critic Jason Zinoman pointed out last year, before they became
   rakish lovers, vampires appeared in medieval folklore as “symbols of
   epidemics.” More terrifying, at least psychologically, is the way COVID
   forced every compassionate person to question whether we, too, might be
   asymptomatic monsters flying under the radar. We could take every
   precaution and still get infected—or even unwittingly pass the virus to
   someone who’d eventually die of it.

   Such mistrust of one’s own instincts and intentions is a hallmark of
   the new, introspective vampire. The narrator of Woman, Eating, Lydia,
   is a 23-year-old, Asian and white vampire who is living on her own for
   the first time and literally struggling to put food on her table. She
   doesn’t feed on humans because, as she puts it, “I want to be a good
   person”; before she moved out, her mother sourced contraband pigs’
   blood from a butcher. Mistreated at an internship where she could
   conceivably devour her supervisors and vanish into the night, Lydia
   sees herself not as a coherent being but as a body where human and
   demon uneasily cohabit.

   Bloodthirst aside, this is a pretty effective encapsulation of what it
   means to be a person with free will. Unless we behave so atrociously as
   to destroy any chance of redemption, each of us is the site of a war
   between good and evil that will rage on for as long as we live—and that
   might remain unresolved by any legacy we leave. I mean, how bloody
   relatable is that?
