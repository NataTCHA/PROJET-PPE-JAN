   A bipartisan set of New Jersey lawmakers want to expand state law to
   allow stalking victims to get restraining orders against their
   harassers, even if they’re being stalked by a stranger.

   Restraining orders are meant to protect victims of domestic violence

   It’s possible for an adult stalking victim to get a restraining order
   against a stranger, but they must wait for their stalker to be
   convicted on related charges, such as harassment.

   “The sort of loophole here is where a conviction hasn’t taken place,
   and it’s also a stranger, so I think this would be an excellent
   addition to that body of law,” said Sen. Linda Greenstein
   (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime sponsor.
