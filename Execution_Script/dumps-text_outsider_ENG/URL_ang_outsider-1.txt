   It is rare that a couture house is better known for what it does today
   than what it did a century ago. Dior, Chanel and Balenciaga are among
   the famous Parisian fashion labels to tap into their significant
   couture heritage to validate what they do now. However, Elsa
   Schiaparelli, who founded her maison in 1927 and shuttered it in 1954
   after accruing large debts, is far less well-known.

   Having lain dormant for 60 years, Schiaparelli was relaunched amid much
   excitement in 2012 by Italian fashion tycoon Diego Della Valle,
   chairman of Tod’s Group. Fabled guest designer Christian Lacroix was
   enlisted to create the initial collection, which was presented in
   Schiaparelli’s lovingly restored headquarters at 21, Place Vendome.

   However, it wasn’t until American singer Lady Gaga appeared in a
   spectacular custom-designed outfit to sing at President Biden’s
   inauguration that the Schiaparelli name truly registered on the radar
   of anyone outside the fashion world. The designer of that dress was
   Texan Daniel Roseberry, the thoughtful, quietly spoken son of an
   Anglican minister who was appointed creative director of the house of
   Schiaparelli in April 2019.

   Schiaparelli was a competitor of Gabrielle Chanel and one of the most
   revered fashion names in the first half of the 20th century. Her
   pioneering collaborations included tie-ups with surrealist artists such
   as Jean Cocteau, Man Ray and Salvador Dali. Her use of “shocking” pink
   and witty details including the shoe hat, lobster dress, trompe d’oeil
   tear dress and chest of drawer pocket details on tailoring are examples
   of her irreverent design vocabulary. These relationships are explored
   in Shocking! The Surreal World of Elsa Schiaparelli, an exhibition at
   the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris that opened this summer and will
   run until January 22.

   In only 25 years, Schiaparelli turned fashion into a natural expression
   of the avant garde. She embodied the vision of a bright and vibrant
   Paris, curious about everything and enjoying each novelty that came her
   way. In November 1934, Harper’s Bazaar pronounced her to be “the most
   daring and original talent in the French dressmaking world … with
   volcanic energy and a fantastically fecund sense of modern invention”.

   When she died in 1973, Cristobal Balenciaga proclaimed her “the only
   real artist in couture”. Yves Saint Laurent similarly observed: “When
   she died, chic closed her eyes.”

   Schiaparelli was not just a dressmaker, she was “a brand maker”,
   explains Roseberry, sitting in the almost bare white studio overlooking
   the bustling Place Vendome where he spent the weekends during the
   pandemic sketching alone, in what at the time felt like an abandoned
   city. He realises, in hindsight, that it was a privilege and an
   incredibly inspiring time to think about her heritage, almost as if the
   ghost of Schiaparelli was looking over his shoulder.

   “Her legacy is incredibly modern — the house is complicated because her
   work is specific and singular, but is still very relevant today,”
   Roseberry says, pointing out that relaunches of storied houses don’t
   always work. Like Vionnet, he suggests, who created a methodology about
   how to cut a garment rather than a lasting vision.

   Roseberry believes the exhibition at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs lays
   bare “Elsa’s contribution to fashion — she was the first person to
   cross fashion with pop culture, but with artists that were the pop
   culture of that time”.

   In a contemporary world, the creative dialogue between fashion and art
   has become almost commonplace, but Schiaparelli was the first to start
   that conversation. Perhaps because of her background, she was drawn
   into the bohemian world of artists.

   An aristocrat, she grew up in a Baroque palace in Italy surrounded by
   Italian renaissance and classical antiquity and, intellectually, that
   went on to be reflected in her collections. Her father was an academic
   who specialised in the Islamic world and Middle Ages, while her uncle
   was a renowned astronomer. Schiaparelli, therefore, felt far more
   comfortable in the company of artists than in the Parisian “society” of
   her time.

   She was an outsider, something that Roseberry can relate to coming to
   Paris as a little-known designer from Texas, who had spent 11 years
   working in New York at Thom Browne, a designer who himself likes to
   play with surrealist concepts. “I can see that there is a freedom to
   being an outsider that gives you permission to play by the rules or
   not,” Roseberry says. “I think there is something about this outsider’s
   perspective, where mastering something that you were not raised with
   gives you a different perspective.”

   The house has given him the freedom to be himself, and while constantly
   linking back to Schiaparelli, “there are also things that are uniquely
   and personally mine”, Roseberry says.

   He initially launched into her madcap world with moulded tailoring and
   an evaluation of how he would approach the figure, something that has
   been part of his creative process since enrolling for life drawing
   classes at the age of 16. This focus on silhouette also relates to the
   famous hourglass body of Schiaparelli’s signature perfume bottle for
   Shocking, with a tape measure creating a trompe l’oeil detail that
   Roseberry has since reproduced on jackets.

   However, it is the eye-catching jewellery featuring parts of the
   anatomy that has made people sit up and notice. His gold body castings,
   he admits, caused a visceral reaction in the fashion world. Referencing
   the oversized gilded jewellery of the 1930s, 1970s and 1980s, they
   include cast ears, eyes, teeth and nose jewellery, gold toes on black
   shoes and lung necklaces, which Bella Hadid famously wore with a
   scooped neckline dress to the Cannes Film Festival last year. They were
   the first surrealist tropes that could live in a modern environment —
   however, he is conscious that the joke can wear thin, so expect
   something fresh and different in seasons to come.

   Overall, Roseberry has taken a very restrained approach to the
   extraordinary legacy that Elsa Schiaparelli left behind.

   “It’s about wearing the heritage in the archives very lightly because
   they can become a great burden, I think. Visually they are so striking
   and so specific and it’s not even silhouette driven, it’s even more
   specific than that,” explains Roseberry.

   He wants to rouse the same thrill at seeing something new that
   Schiaparelli did in her day, without endlessly mimicking her work. “I
   don’t think that is what she would have wanted today.” The exhibition
   features not only Schiaparelli’s archives, but also the work of
   designers such as Azzedine Alaia and John Galliano, who were inspired
   by the couturier, and of course pieces from Roseberry’s collections,
   including autumn/winter 2022, which featured the black velvet corset
   and pants with hand-painted flowers that Cate Blanchett wore to the
   Venice Film Festival last month, and Lady Gaga’s famous inauguration
   outfit.

   Roseberry has only been at Schiaparelli three years, but beyond Lady
   Gaga, he has chalked up several memorable red carpet moments with stars
   such as Adele, Cardi B, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan. His
   personal favourite looks were Lady Gaga and Bella Hadid’s, along with
   the leather body-conscious dress Beyonce wore the night she set the
   record for the most Grammys won by a singer.

   “I am so honoured to be part of that,” Roseberry muses, but also
   describes the exhibition opening, sharing a platform with the great
   Elsa Schiaparelli, as a “mind-blowing moment that will go down in
   memory”. It has been a remarkable trajectory for the man from Texas.
