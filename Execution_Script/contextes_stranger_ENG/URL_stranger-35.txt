The Stranger What’s Up With the Title?

   Let's start with: "What is the title?" In case you didn't know, Camus
   was French; so he wrote The Stranger in French, and, because it seemed
   appropriate, gave it a French title: L'Étranger. Here's where things
   get tricky—in the translation. "L'Étranger" could have easily been
   translated as "The Foreigner" instead of as "The Stranger," and
   actually is in some cases.

   This is based on the word "foreigner," but the same thing applies to
   the title The Stranger. Meursault is a stranger among other people
   because he is so isolated from them—mentally, emotionally, spiritually,
   and, by the end of the text, physically (he's imprisoned).

   He's strange. He's the strangest. He's the stranger.
