Foreigner

   Build Status Code Climate

   Foreigner introduces a few methods to your migrations for adding and
   removing foreign key constraints. It also dumps foreign keys to
   schema.rb.
--
     * sqlite (foreign key methods are a no-op)

   Foreigner was rendered obsolete in Rails 4.2. The migration DSL
   supports foreign keys out of the box via add_foreign_key and
   remove_foreign_key.
--

   Add the following to your Gemfile:
gem 'foreigner'

API Examples

   Foreigner adds two methods to migrations.
     * add_foreign_key(from_table, to_table, options)
     * remove_foreign_key(from_table, to_table, options)
--
Change Table Methods

Database-specific options

   Database-specific options will never be supported by foreigner. You can
   add them using :options:
add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts, options: 'ON UPDATE DEFERRED')

Foreigner Add-ons

     * immigrant - generate a migration that includes all missing foreign
       keys.
     * sqlserver-foreigner - A plugin for SQL Server.
