Bipartisan bill would end ‘stranger loophole’ for restraining orders

   A bipartisan set of New Jersey lawmakers want to expand state law to
   allow stalking victims to get restraining orders against their
   harassers, even if they’re being stalked by a stranger.

   Restraining orders are meant to protect victims of domestic violence
   cases. They are civil orders and do not require criminal charges to be
   filed against the defendant, though such charges often accompany
   restraining orders.

   Under state statute, the only times restraining orders can be issued
   without a conviction are in domestic violence cases — meaning they can
   bar a family member or one-time significant other from contacting the
   victim — or in stalking cases involving minors or adults who cannot
   provide consent because of a disorder.

   While the individual provisions of a given order vary depending on the
   case, they can bar a defendant from contacting the victim and their
   friends or family members, block them from entering the victim’s home
   or place of work, and allow police to seize firearms belonging to the
   defendant, among other things.

   Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said he signed on as a co-sponsor after
   hearing from the family of a 27-year-old woman who, after receiving
   strange and threatening messages at all hours from a man she had never
   dated, was unable to get a restraining order against her stalker.

   “Long story short, she goes to the police station, the police say,
   ‘Well, you can’t get a restraining order. You’ve got to file criminal
   charges,’” Bramnick said. “Meanwhile, the police don’t do it, so you
   have to do it yourself.”

   The woman has since filed criminal charges, but the stalker is free to
   contact her while the trial is ongoing, the senator said.

   It’s possible for an adult stalking victim to get a restraining order
   against a stranger, but they must wait for their stalker to be
   convicted on related charges, such as harassment.

   “The sort of loophole here is where a conviction hasn’t taken place,
   and it’s also a stranger, so I think this would be an excellent
   addition to that body of law,” said Sen. Linda Greenstein
   (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime sponsor.

   Alleged stalkers might be barred from contacting the victim by a
   separate judicial order — like a no-contact order, for instance — but
   breaching such accords doesn’t always carry the immediate criminal
   penalties attached to restraining order violations.

   If a defendant violates the restraints set by an order, they’re likely
   to face criminal contempt charges, which can carry a prison term of up
   to 18 months.

   The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which may
   meet to confirm judges during legislators’ customary summer recess.
   That leaves a chance the bill could advance before lawmakers return to
   Trenton in earnest come September.
