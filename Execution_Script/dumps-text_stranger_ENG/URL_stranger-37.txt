   I am often asked, even by colleagues in the mental health field, "What
   is Depersonalization Disorder?" For doctors and patients alike,
   Depersonalization Disorder, or DPD, is somewhat mysterious and
   difficult to define. And yet, some researchers consider it to be the
   third most common mental disorder, after depression and anxiety.
   Several research studies indicate that more than half of college
   students have experienced elements of depersonalization at one time or
   another. And many creative people, such as Poe or Sartre, have suffered
   from it. Deuce Bigelow director Harris Goldberg explored his
   experiences of depersonalization in the movie Numb.

   Depersonalization may happen when you first wake up, or while flying on
   an airplane. You may link it to acute trauma or years of chronic
   stress, or to nothing at all. Sometimes it happens after smoking
   marijuana or using "club drugs."

   The first signs are often felt as a "mental break." Suddenly,
   inexplicably, something changes—common objects and familiar situations
   seem strange or foreign, as if you've found yourself in an unfamiliar
   world. And at the same time, you feel unreal or "not yourself." You
   close your eyes and turn inward, but the very thoughts running through
   your head seem different. Patients feel as if they have no self that
   formerly enabled them to deal with the world around them, and with
   their inner world.

   The most clinically true and psychologically sharp descriptions of
   depersonalization are those given by people with DPD. In his excellent
   book, Stranger to Myself, medical journalist and DPD survivor Jeffrey
   Abugel summarizes eight symptoms a person with DPD may experience.

   Feeling panic. When a person first experiences DPD, he often feels as
   if he is going mad. Patients report feeling panic-stricken, trapped
   inside themselves, or thrown into an unfamiliar world they can't
   escape.

   Lack of emotion. People with DPD describe feeling inhuman, like a robot
   or a rock. They experience a loss of spirit, an absence of emotions,
   and no mood changes.

   Feeling detached. People with DPD feel distant from others and
   themselves. Many describe the feeling of watching themselves, as if
   from above. Once-familiar objects seem strange.

   Fixation/obsession. People with DPD repeatedly check their sanity. They
   sometimes fixate on the strangeness or foreignness of a single thought
   or object.

   Abstract ruminating. People with DPD often dwell on the ideas of
   eternity and infinity. They think over and over about the nature of
   existence or the void and the dark mysteries of life.

   Lifestyle changes. People with DPD are sometimes afraid to leave their
   houses or engage in activities that might trigger panic attacks. They
   stop traveling, talking to others, watching TV, or even going to
   doctors.

   Feeling possessed. People with DPD in some cases report feeling as if
   an evil entity has taken up residence inside their head, watching them
   and making negative comments.

   Acting "as if." People with DPD suffer from not feeling that they are
   acting, but instead they have a strange feeling of "as-if acting." They
   feel that they imitate moods and expressions as if trying to act normal
   around others. But they continue to feel like outsiders who aren't part
   of ordinary life.

   Like many psychopathological signs, depersonalization can linger for
   years, go away, and then return. Some people with depersonalization
   sometimes suffer devastating consequences in their personal and
   professional lives, while others can continue to function fairly well
   while they seek treatment.

   If you think you may have depersonalization, it is crucial to seek out
   a physician you feel attuned to, preferably one who has experience
   treating depersonalization, and in whom you have confidence. There are
   also good informational sites on the web where you can share your
   stories and get support from other DPD survivors. One of my favorites
   is an online community hosted by the aforementioned author Jeffrey
   Abugel.
