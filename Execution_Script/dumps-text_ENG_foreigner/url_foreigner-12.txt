             Africa Is Not Immune to the Rising Tide of Xenophobia

   By
          Thomas Lesaffre

   Xenophobic politics aren’t just on the rise in the West, but in African
   countries like South Africa. And the culprit is similar: a ruling elite
   that refuses to address rapacious economic inequality and instead fans
   the flame of anti-foreign resentment.

   In South Africa there seems to be a seasonal shift: discussions around
   Zimbabwe and Lesotho workers permits are being hosted by cabinet; laws
   and administration around visa renewals and working permits have been
   changed in the last few months; members of the governing party, the
   African National Congress, are asking for border reinforcement and
   openly associating foreigner activities in the country with insecurity
   as opposed to economic growth. Finally, news highlights in South Africa
   now include scenes of burnt shacks, palpable fear, and public protests
   as angry mobs frantically search for undocumented foreigners. To fully
   understand why South Africa and its democratic institutions are
   entering a nationalist winter, a snippet of African political history
   is helpful.

   Naturally, xenophobia is not a new phenomenon for the rainbow nation;
   xenophobic violence dates back to 2008 and has already been largely
   commented on through an array of media platforms. However, what seems
   to be surfacing is a new form of institutionalized xenophobia rising
   from within the state. A few years ago, no political entrepreneurs had
   seriously taken ownership of the xenophobic agenda. The issue mainly
   emerged from an impoverished population that focused their efforts on
   looting local spaza shops typically owned by foreigners from other
   African countries, as opposed to retail giants owned by white South
   African capital (which was what happened during the July riots of
   2021).

   Elsewhere on the continent, other historical examples of such narrow
   nationalism abound. In 1989, in the middle of a long economic crisis
   and after many marches contesting his power, president Abdou Diouf of
   Senegal signed a decree to expel approximately 170,000 Mauritanians. At
   that point, the Parti Socialist Senegalais of Léopold Sédar Senghor had
   been in power since independence in 1960, and Diouf was Senghor’s
   successor. President Diouf did what many had done before him in
   response to an economic meltdown: blame the “aliens” and “foreigners”
   in a clumsy attempt to gain back political legitimacy without
   addressing the inequities of a rapacious neoliberal economic order.

   In 1968, only two years after toppling the Ghanaian father of
   independence and pan-African hero, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanaian prime
   minister Kofi Busia fell into the same trap: blaming foreigners, rather
   than the national bourgeoisie for the country’s economic downfall. In
   1968, Legislative Instrument 553 decreed that all non-Ghanaians had to
   have a work permit before they could act as employer, self-employed
   person, or employees. A Compliance Order was issued in the same year
   giving all foreigners without residence permits two weeks to obtain
   them or leave the country. Naturally, very few Africans had the
   necessary papers, and could not even claim it from their
   institutionally weak embassy. The police and the army were sent to
   search for and arrest all foreign nationals lacking papers. Ghanaians
   were encouraged to believe that the departure of the “aliens” would
   solve all the country’s economic problems. Most of them were Nigerian
   and ended up coming back in the middle of the Biafra civil war.

   Busia’s fall from power was even faster than Diouf ’s in Senegal. It
   took Ghanaians only a few months to realize they had been played and he
   was forced into exile in England the following year. The rise of
   xenophobic politics from within the state itself did not bring back
   economic growth in the country. Instead, inflation skyrocketed and food
   was scarce. Unable to address these economic challenges and faced with
   rising popular anger, the state responded militarily to discipline its
   own citizens, forcing millions of Ghanaian youth to leave the country
   on the very same roads that were once used to expel foreign nationals.

   Millions of them arrived in Nigeria, where a petroleum-driven economy
   was booming. As petrol prices began to rise, Nigeria had nationalized
   the industry and attained a production level of more than two million
   barrels of crude oil a day. By 1982, the oil industries had generated
   more than US$101 billion for the country’s elites. Not only were there
   West Africans entering Nigeria, but there was an influx of people from
   rural areas migrating to the cities. Life was good. However, due to a
   recession in the large petroleum consumer market in the early 1980s,
   the economic boom in Nigeria waned significantly. President Shehu
   Shagari, then, found himself in the same position as his Ghanaian
   counterpart a few years before. The state under his leadership
   responded similarly, and in 1982, began expelling nonnationals,
   criminalizing their activities and blaming them for the failing
   economy. Most businesses they owned crumbled and the few that survived
   were shared within power circles and extended to the party patronage.
   Like in Ghana and Senegal, it did not make the economic situation
   better for all, but rather reinforced a kleptocratic elite.

   By the time the Nigerian national election of 1983 came about, Shagari
   and the policemen in charge of the “Ghana Must Go” operation directed
   their violence toward impoverished Nigerian citizens demanding change
   where none was forthcoming after the expulsion of foreign nationals.
   For the Nigerian governing elite, institutionalizing xenophobia was a
   step to reinforce the state’s capacity to discipline the masses, while
   at the same time politically trying to gain back legitimacy. Less than
   nine months after Shagari was kicked out of power, he had to flee the
   country like Kofi Busia. A year later, then military ruler General
   Muhammdu Buhari (who is now Nigeria’s incumbent president), announced
   another round of expulsions, this time, of all foreigners, including
   those with residence permits. About seven hundred thousand people were
   forced out of the country.

   Returning to present-day South Africa, after twenty-nine years of
   neoliberal failure, xenophobia appears a satisfying answer for a
   national bourgeoisie that has thus far avoided redistributing
   sufficient wealth to the majority of South Africans, who remain
   impoverished and exploited. South African exceptionalism is a myth; we
   are not alone in facing the morbid symptoms of postcolonial decay,
   where national elites, often erstwhile liberators, lack political
   imagination.

   Institutionalized xenophobia offers false narratives of better days to
   come. Indeed, African political history teaches us that for a short
   period of time the national elite is safe, being seen as “doing its
   job” for the people, but the chimera won’t last. If and when foreigners
   leave, the situation will not improve. People’s anger will be
   redirected to the national elite, as demonstrated in Nigeria, Ghana,
   and Senegal.
