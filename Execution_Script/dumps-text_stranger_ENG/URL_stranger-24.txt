The Stranger Introduction
     __________________________________________________________________

   Want more deets? We've also got a complete Online Course about The
   Stranger, with three weeks worth of readings and activities to make
   sure you know your stuff.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What's the first thing you think of when we say the word "absurd"? A
   baby rhino trying to act like a baby goat?  Fashion week? Maybe an
   eleven minute long homage to 80's sitcoms starring a bearded
   psychopath?  Or how about a platypus (have you ever really looked at
   one)?

   Okay—try this absurd tidbit on for size: a man loses his mom, murders a
   dude on a beach, and is sentenced to death.

   Wait. What?

   The Stranger—or L'Étranger, if you want to be all authentically French
   about it (pro-tip: lose the beret and the baguette)—is an absurdist
   novel about a bonafide weirdo named Meursault. This charming guy shoots
   and kills a man, Johnny Cash-style, just to watch him die.

   But this ain't just a feel-bad book about a cold-blooded seaside
   murder. Camus uses all the events leading up to the shooting (and
   Meursault's subsequent trial, and prison sentence) to explore issues of
   meaning and meaninglessness in life. In other words, Camus's book is
   about Philosophy with a capital P.

   So who was this Camus guy, anyway? He was a trés famous French thinker
   known for his philosophy of the absurd, which is a cousin of the
   philosophy of existentialism. But don't go saying that Camus was an
   existentialist—having his philosophical musings pegged as
   existentialism was a huge pet peeve of Camus' back when he was alive
   (and channeling Humphrey Bogart).

   These days, Camus is most famous as the author of three big-deal
   novels: The Stranger (1942), The Plague (1947), and The Fall (1956).
   Starting on The Stranger is a good call: Camus' later novels kept
   getting more complex… which is not to say that The Stranger is
   lightweight. After all, it explores a philosophy that states that the
   world is devoid of all rational meaning.

   But at least one absolutely rational decision came about because of
   Camus' scribblings. In 1957 the Nobel Prize Committee gave him the
   Nobel Prize for Literature for his generally "important literary
   production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the
   problems of the human conscience in our times."

   And once you read The Stranger, you'll understand that handing Camus
   the big daddy of all literary prizes is the exact opposite of
   absurdity. It makes 100%, no-questions-asked sense.

What is The Stranger About and Why Should I Care?

   What do you have in common with Meursault, the murderous,
   semi-sociopathic, unlikeable, unloving, chain-smoking, detached,
   sun-averse protagonist of The Stranger?

   The answer is, uncomfortably, more than you'd think.

   We're guessing that you, dearest Shmooper, are a totally lovely
   individual that wouldn't do hideous things like lose interest during
   your mother's funeral or shoot some random guy in ice-cold blood.
   Actually, we're sure of it.

   But we're equally sure that you—like all of us—have felt weird moments
   of questioning and detachment. We're talking about everything from
   those terrifying midnight episodes where you stare at the ceiling and
   think, "What does it all mean?" to thinking "Oh dang. Is that me?" when
   you hear your voice in a recording, to that deflated feeling you get
   after something big occurs—your birthday, a break-up, an election—and
   you wake up the next day and everything seems… exactly the same as it
   was before.

   Those moments are weird, and you feel weird within them. Or, to put it
   another way: life is pretty strange, and you often feel like a stranger
   (The Stranger, in fact) within it.

   Yes, Meursault is a guy who is emotionally incapable, socially unaware,
   and understands relationships only in the context of the physical. He's
   like Sherlock Holmes or Lisbeth Salander, but weirder and not a
   detective.

   But this stranger is also an introspective philosophical rebel. And the
   philosophy that he and Camus promote—the philosophy of absurdism—states
   that the world is so nonsensical, so absurd, that you can't expect to
   find meaning in it anywhere. There's no logic, no rationale, no
   governing order.

   That might sound kind of insane (and super lonely) to you. But that,
   friends, is exactly the point. Absurdism doesn't say "When life gives
   you lemons, make lemonade." Absurdism says, "When life gives you
   lemons, eat that lemon as if it was a dang apple."

   This philosophical stance isn't everyone's cup of tea (or mouthful of
   lemon pulp). But it can be useful, when faced with the hyper-bizarre
   stuff that life can lob in your direction, to be able to think, "Huh.
   That makes no sense whatsoever," and leave it at that.

   So while we definitely don't advocate that you treat Meursault as a
   role model, we do think that adopting his—and Camus'—philosophy can be
   strangely (hey-o!) comforting.

   Or, you know, you can just read The Stranger because it's a
   crazy-important and seminal text of the 20th Century and helped Albert
   Camus win a Nobel Prize. It's a win-win situation… unlike a lot of the
   absurd situations you come across in this crazy, messed-up world.
