Foreigner

   Build Status Code Climate

   Foreigner introduces a few methods to your migrations for adding and
   removing foreign key constraints. It also dumps foreign keys to
   schema.rb.

   The following adapters are supported:
     * mysql2
     * postgres
     * sqlite (foreign key methods are a no-op)

   Foreigner was rendered obsolete in Rails 4.2. The migration DSL
   supports foreign keys out of the box via add_foreign_key and
   remove_foreign_key.

Installation

   Add the following to your Gemfile:
gem 'foreigner'

API Examples

   Foreigner adds two methods to migrations.
     * add_foreign_key(from_table, to_table, options)
     * remove_foreign_key(from_table, to_table, options)

   (Options are documented in
   connection_adapters/abstract/schema_statements.rb):

   For example, given the following model:
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :post
end

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments, dependent: :delete_all
end

   You should add a foreign key in your migration:
add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts)

   The :dependent option can be moved from the has_many definition to the
   foreign key:
add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts, dependent: :delete)

   If the column is named article_id instead of post_id, use the :column
   option:
add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts, column: 'article_id')

   A name can be specified for the foreign key constraint:
add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts, name: 'comment_article_foreign_key')

   The :column and :name options create a foreign key with a custom name.
   In order to remove it you need to specify :name:
remove_foreign_key(:comments, name: 'comment_article_foreign_key')

Change Table Methods

   Foreigner adds extra methods to create_table and change_table.

   Create a new table with a foreign key:
create_table :products do |t|
  t.string :name
  t.integer :factory_id
  t.foreign_key :factories
end

   Add a missing foreign key to comments:
change_table :comments do |t|
  t.foreign_key :posts, dependent: :delete
end

   Remove an unwanted foreign key:
change_table :comments do |t|
  t.remove_foreign_key :users
end

Database-specific options

   Database-specific options will never be supported by foreigner. You can
   add them using :options:
add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts, options: 'ON UPDATE DEFERRED')

Foreigner Add-ons

     * immigrant - generate a migration that includes all missing foreign
       keys.
     * sqlserver-foreigner - A plugin for SQL Server.
