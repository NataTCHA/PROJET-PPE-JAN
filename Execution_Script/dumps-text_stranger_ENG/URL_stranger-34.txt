The Stranger, The Outsider and The Foreigner

   Thomas Benson

   Translation is, at best, the science of ‘best fit’. Whether in the
   euphemistic, guarded language of politics or the allusive,
   metaphor-heavy literary world, words always carry far more weight than
   just their simple face value, carrying hidden references and allusions.
   The word ‘straight’, for instance on the surface just means linear- a
   ‘straight road’. Yet it carries a whole bundle of associated meanings;
   it can signify honesty, sexuality, neatness, seriousness. A quick look
   at the online Oxford Dictionary shows you the extent of the meanings
   stemming from this simple word.

   This makes the lives of translators very problematic, and the
   difficulties are nowhere more pronounced than in literature. Take the
   title of Camus’ most famous book- L’Étranger. In French, this word
   carries three associated but nevertheless distinct meanings: the
   stranger, the foreigner and the outsider. All of these words have some
   degree of claim to representing the French title, and conveying Camus’
   intentions, but none of them can truly represent the meaning of the
   original word. As it is, the title is usually translated as either The
   Outsider or The Stranger, although The Outsider proves the less popular
   choice; probably due to the phonic similarity between ‘stranger’ and
   the original title.

   Moving beyond the title into the first line, one of the most famous in
   French literature – ‘Aujourd’hui, maman est mort’- and the debate
   continues. How do we translate ‘maman’? Mersault, the main character,
   is a cold, unfeeling outsider (or stranger); the choice of how he
   reacts to his mother’s death will set the tone for the novel as a
   whole. Mother is too cold and formal, mum is too monosyllabic and
   informal. ‘Maman’ sits between the two and is the reason that Matthew
   Ward left it untranslated in his edition (he also plumped for The
   Stranger).  Recently, a new edition of L’Étranger was published that
   translated the line as ‘My mother died today’, introducing a new warmth
   and sentimental attachment.

   The debate then is over the structure of the line itself. Should the
   structure of the sentence remain the same- ‘Today, mother died’- or the
   more fluid ‘Mother died today’? While the latter sounds more
   Anglophonic, it carries none of the associated meaning of Camus’
   original. It is significant that Mersault lists the time before the
   death of his mother. He lives without a concept of past and future,
   living in the present. He concentrates on his life as it happens,
   disregarding the past and not bothering to foretell the future
   consequences of his actions; his emotional and temporal detachment
   render him cold, uncaring, and unlikeable. ‘Today, mother died’ is far
   more consistent with his outlook and with the next sentence of the
   novel- ‘or yesterday; I don’t know.’

   So much to consider from the first sentence, and the task of the
   translator will not get much easier throughout the novel. Exploring the
   minefield of meaning is a difficult task, but an enjoyable one; a form
   of mental yoga, stretching meanings and contorting sentence structure
   until the original intent of the author is adequately conveyed. It is
   just a shame that Camus himself is not around; it would have been
   interesting to see which translation he chose.
