4 Signs That a Stranger Poses Danger

Not paranoia, but preparedness. How to separate the helpful from the harmful.

   Strangers often turn into friends, co-workers, or even life partners.
   We are motivated to view others positively, because of this potential
   for building productive relationships. Yet sensing danger should
   curtail your initial level of courtesy.

   Strangers Are Statistically Safe

   As we prepare to head into April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness
   Month, we begin with the observation that most strangers are safe — or
   at least harmless. As strange as it sounds to put it that way,
   statistically speaking, it is true. Yet it is precisely because the
   majority of people are harmless that we extend the benefit of the doubt
   to those who are not.

   To put the danger into perspective, I have spent the last 20-plus years
   prosecuting the exceptions to the harmless stranger rule. And those
   exceptions will keep myself and my colleagues in the District
   Attorney's Office employed for the rest of our careers. In other words,
   the level of risk from stranger danger is statistically low, but
   significantly serious.

   This risk is enhanced by the reality that in most cases, we are unable
   to spot dangerous people merely by looking. Actions speak louder than
   words, and appearances can be deceiving. Here are some safety
   strategies to help you separate the harmful from the harmless.

   Context Counts

   Stranger danger includes both risk of criminal behavior and of sexual
   harassment — which even if it does not include physical contact, can
   have significant adverse consequences.

   Research indicates that stranger harassment results in more negative
   outcomes than workplace harassment, with incidents involving physical
   contact causing the most negative reactions.[1] It further reveals that
   harassment taking place at a bar caused less negative reactions than
   harassment at a store or at an office, a finding believed to be
   consistent with the interaction between perceived sexual harassment and
   permissive social norms.[2]

   Yet not all strangers display harassing behavior. Some are even more
   dangerous, charming, and disarming by clothing themselves in courtesy.
   These wolves in sheep's clothing prey on victims by capitalizing on
   social norms of helpfulness and cooperation in either requesting or
   offering assistance.

   Requests for Personal Assistance

   We all want to live by the biblical and social mandate, “Do unto
   others.” Following the Golden Rule, we would love to help everyone in
   all situations. But beware of the seemingly able-bodied stranger who
   approaches you requesting assistance, particularly in an environment
   with lots of available options, such as train stations and airports.

   This person may be harmless, but you should remain attuned to your
   instincts. Direct someone who makes you uncomfortable to an information
   counter or to local authorities for help. And in an era when almost
   everyone has a cell phone, do not feel pressured to lend someone yours,
   which will give them access to your personal information, including
   private numbers, passwords, and photographs of your kids.

   Assistance Insistence

   Some people, both good and bad, offer assistance instead of requesting
   it. As a general rule, helpful people are wonderful, as we welcome both
   aid and altruism.

   Helping behavior enhances interpersonal warmth, because helping is
   believed to demonstrate kindness.[3] Helping also generates perceived
   competence through demonstrating valuable skills or essential
   information, resulting in elevated status attributed to the helper.[4]

   Yet a stranger's true intentions are often revealed in reaction to your
   response. While most strangers are gracious whether you accept their
   help or not, a further offer becomes inappropriate after you have
   declined assistance.

   It is appropriate to accept a stranger's offer to lift your heavy
   briefcase into the overhead compartment on a crowded airplane. It is
   inappropriate to have a stranger approach you outside your neighborhood
   market and insist on carrying your groceries to your car — particularly
   after you have said “no.” Be wary of any sentence that begins with “I
   insist.” And keep a firm grasp on your belongings when declining
   assistance, as a predator intent on pursuing an opportunity for sexual
   assault will attempt to grab your belongings right out of your hand.

   The Open Nook

   When you meet friendly strangers, your level of disclosure will depend
   on your level of comfort. Remember that it is not rude to keep personal
   details to yourself. Along these lines, beware the open book (or the
   open "nook" in the digital era).

   Predators may attempt to elicit personal details from you by revealing
   their own. Providing too much information, or “TMI," can be a ploy to
   create a sense of obligation on your part to reciprocate. Don't fall
   for it. There is no rule of reciprocity that requires you to share
   private details with a stranger, regardless of how much they share with
   you.

   And remember that you cannot always judge a book by its cover. When
   getting to know a new acquaintance, what you assumed was an authentic
   autobiography may in fact be fiction.

   From Foot in the Door to Door in the Face

   We remind our children to mind their manners, and we try to do the
   same. Yet with a stranger who makes you uncomfortable, don't. If you
   realize you have allowed someone who makes you uncomfortable to get a
   foot in the door, close it.
