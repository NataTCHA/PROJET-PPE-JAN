   Honorable Mention for the 2022 Betty and Alfred McClung Lee Book Award,
   sponsored by the Association for Humanist Sociology.

   Many enter the academy with dreams of doing good; this is a book about
   how the institution fails them, especially if they are considered
   "outsiders."

   Tenure-track, published author, recipient of prestigious fellowships
   and awards—these credentials mark Victoria Reyes as somebody who has
   achieved the status of insider in the academy. Woman of color, family
   history of sexual violence, first generation, mother—these qualities
   place Reyes on the margins of the academy; a person who does not see
   herself reflected in its models of excellence.

   This contradiction allows Reyes to theorize the conditional citizenship
   of academic life—a liminal status occupied by a rapidly growing
   proportion of the academy, as the majority white, male, and affluent
   space simultaneously transforms and resists transformation. Reyes
   blends her own personal experiences with the tools of sociology to lay
   bare the ways in which the structures of the university and the people
   working within it continue to keep their traditionally marginalized
   members relegated to symbolic status, somewhere outside the center.

   Reyes confronts the impossibility of success in the midst of competing
   and contradictory needs—from navigating coded language, to balancing
   professional expectations with care-taking responsibilities, to
   combating the literal exclusions of outmoded and hierarchical rules.
   Her searing commentary takes on, with sensitivity and fury, the urgent
   call for academic justice.

   About the author

   Victoria Reyes is Assistant Professor in the Department of Gender &
   Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside. She is the
   author of multi-award-winning book Global Borderlands (Stanford, 2019),
   which was named a 2020 CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title.

   "This courageous and visionary work boldly reclaims space for women of
   color and others who have been excluded and devalued by academia. It
   invites us to reimagine and remake the academy with practices of love,
   care, and justice."

   —Crystal Marie Fleming, author of Rise Up!

   "Blending sociological analysis, feminist of color critique, and
   memoir, Reyes offers a blueprint for transforming the academy. Academic
   Outsider is the book I never knew I needed until I read it."

   —Anthony Christian Ocampo, author of Brown and Gay in LA

   "This book will be painfully familiar to many in the academy. It
   reveals how little progress has been made in the age of
   multiculturalism and diversity. A must-read for junior and senior
   faculty alike!"

   —Mary Romero, author of The Maid's Daughter

   "This book brings a level of authenticity to academia, and sociology in
   particular, that is a breath of fresh air. It works as an important
   intervention within how we see academia and who we see as exemplar
   academics. I praise the author for their vulnerability and their
   conviction—we need to better humanize scholarship and this book does
   just that."

   —Whitney Pirtle, co-editor of Black Feminist Sociology

   "A challenging and critical collection, Academic Outsider offers a
   timely analysis that interrogates the foundation of the "academic
   citizenship" that leaves many of us questioning our value rather than
   the logics of belonging embedded in the whiteness and wealth of
   academia. By weaving together personal and professional stories and
   sociological analysis, these incisive essays will surely spark
   conversation and serve as a balm for the many outsiders navigating
   their own pathway."

   —Zakiya Luna, author of Reproductive Rights as Human Rights

   "An urgent, candid, and path-breaking book. Academic Outsider uncovers
   the hidden curricula of academic gate-keeping practices and
   demonstrates how they are upheld by racial capitalism and racialized
   gender inequities. Without falling into a romanticized view of the
   margins, Reyes exposes the raw gritty effects of such practices on
   working-class women of color in the academy. She deftly unmasks the
   material conditions that make these women's lives impossible, begging
   the question: who belongs in academia and who does not? With careful
   attention to how the personal is always political, Reyes
   unapologetically deploys women of color feminisms to expose the
   normalized structures of gendered, classed, and racialized violences
   cloaked by disciplinary metrics of success. This page-turner of a book
   will resonate with those who are marginalized by the academy and those
   who are complicit with its operations. This book embodies
   intersectional public scholarship at its finest."

   —Ghassan Moussawi, author of Disruptions Situations

   "Not everyone is an equal citizen in the country of academia. Writing
   from within the borderlands of higher education in Academic Outsider,
   sociologist and professor Victoria Reyes describes with courage,
   insight, and heart about what the Ivory Tower's shadow hides. This book
   is must-read for anyone who truly cares about equality and
   inclusiveness in the academy."

   —Grace Talusan, author of The Body Papers

   "Academic Outsider is the kind of book that sticks with you. The kind
   of book that forces you to notice inequities and that would give you
   side-eye if you saw those inequities and tried to look away. The essays
   in Academic Outsider are poignant and sometimes painful to read. Yet,
   they are also poignant and painful in a way that leaves room for hope.
   The book inspires readers to recognize and embrace opportunities to
   resist the oppressive structures within academia and the oppressive
   structures that academia helps to perpetuate."

   —Jessica Calarco, author of A Field Guide to Grad School and
   Negotiating Opportunities
