Toni Morrison at the Louvre

   The Foreigner’s Home is a feature-length documentary film that explores
   the vision and work of Toni Morrison through “The Foreigner’s Home,”
   the 2006 exhibition she guest-curated at the Louvre. Morrison invited
   renowned artists whose work also deals with the experience of cultural
   and social displacement to join her in a public conversation that she
   had been pursuing for years through her own research and writing and in
   her teaching at Princeton University. The film expands that
   conversation, combining exclusive and unreleased footage of the Nobel
   Laureate in dialogue with artists—first, in Paris in 2006 and then, in
   2015, at her home in New York state—with extensive archival film
   footage, music, and still images to present a series of candid and
   incisive exchanges about race, identity, “foreignness,” and art’s
   redemptive power.

   We are thrilled to announce that The Foreigner's Home will have its
   World Premiere this January at the 47th International Film Festival
   Rotterdam (IFFR) in the Netherlands. The film is part of IFFR's program
   Pan-African Cinema Today for January 26 & 28. See more details HERE.

Music of The Foreigner's Home

   As filmmakers at Oberlin College, we are lucky enough to have ongoing
   relationships with students and faculty at the world-renowned Oberlin
   Conservatory of Music. During the film’s five-year production, we
   worked with many of the Conservatory’s most creative and talented
   students—the great musicians of tomorrow. For the first three years,
   through numerous rough cuts, the film was held together by
   student-created work that set the tone and rhythm of the piece. Later,
   we had the privilege of working with two of the Conservatory’s best
   composers, Jay Ashby, a Grammy winning producer and performer who has
   recorded with some of the industry’s top jazz artists, and Peter V.
   Swendsen, an innovator whose recent work combines field recordings and
   acoustic instruments with electronics and who is currently chair of the
   Technology in Music and the Related Arts Department. Through Jay and
   Peter, we were able to work with prominent Conservatory alumni and
   friends, including Sullivan Fortner and Kim Nazarin, and to record the
   film’s score at Clonick Hall, a state of the art recording studio and
   performance space. The original score, born of an intense and careful
   collaboration among the directors and composers, captures the urgency
   and hope of Toni Morrison’s vision.  View videos about our music
   makers.

JAY ASHBY

   Jay Ashby is a four-time GRAMMY winning producer and has received
   multiple nominations in other categories, including Arranging and
   Engineering. A “consummate musician” whose talents “know few bounds”
   (Pittsburgh Tribune-Review), Ashby has performed, toured, and recorded
   with some of the most renowned jazz artists in the industry for over 30
   years . . . READ MORE

PETER SWENDSEN

   Peter V. Swendsen is interested in creating a sense of place for

   real-world processes in music that combines acoustic instruments with

   Allusions to Seasons and Weather. In 2016, he premiered What Noises
   Remain . . . READ MORE

"The relocation of peoples has ignited and disrupted the idea of home
and expanded the focus of identity beyond definitions of citizenship
