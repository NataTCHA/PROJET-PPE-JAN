‘Panicked’ Truss abandons plan to hire outsider to shake-up Treasury

   British PM picks Treasury veteran James Bowler in last minute U-turn,
   even after Antonia Romeo was offered the job.

   Prime Minister Liz Truss has ditched her plan to hire a dynamic senior
   official to shake-up the Treasury and lead a sweeping overhaul of U.K.
   economic policy, in a sign that a crisis of confidence has gripped her
   faltering, month-old administration.

   In what insiders said was a panic move, Truss at the weekend overruled
   her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng over the appointment of the new chief
   official in the Treasury, a vital decision amid mounting unease over
   the government’s handling of the economy.

   As soon as they took office last month, Truss and Kwarteng fired the
   long-serving permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Tom Scholar,
   apparently wanting fresh leadership at the top of Whitehall’s most
   powerful department.

   Kwarteng and Truss had been preparing to name Antonia Romeo — the
   highest profile business-facing official in government — as Scholar’s
   replacement. Her mission was to have been to drive through an overhaul
   of what Truss’s team had disapprovingly called “Treasury orthodoxy” in
   order to deliver rapid growth.

   Kwarteng and his team had even privately named Romeo as his first
   choice for the role, with Truss’ apparent agreement. But the embattled
   prime minister, reeling from a succession of self-inflicted crises,
   backtracked on the plan and appointed James Bowler, a former Treasury
   insider, instead.

   People familiar with the process said Truss “panicked” over the
   appointment after the government’s tax-cutting mini-budget bombed,
   triggering a massive selloff in the currency and bond markets.

   The people said Romeo had been offered and had accepted the role last
   week. Transition arrangements in preparation for her arrival at the
   Treasury were already under way before the prime minister’s
   U-turn, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing
   confidential matters.

   The chaotic process risks further undermining Truss’ reputation for
   competence and eroding the government’s already damaged credibility on
   its handling of the economy. It also leaves open huge questions over
   what happens to Truss’ personal pledge to deliver “growth, growth,
   growth” .

   Truss and Kwarteng’s decision to push Scholar out last month provoked
   dismay from senior figures in Westminster and Whitehall, including
   former chancellors and two ex-cabinet secretaries.

   They might have got away with it had their first fiscal announcements
   not been a disaster. The Bank of England had to intervene to stabilise
   the market turmoil, pledging to buy up government debt in order to stem
   spiralling borrowing costs.

   Last week, amid a growing political backlash from within the ruling
   Conservative party, Truss decided to reverse Kwarteng’s plan to cut the
   45p top rate of income tax for the highest earners.

   Her decision to overrule him again will raise further doubts about the
   status of their working relationship. Asked repeatedly by broadcasters
   last week whether she trusted her chancellor in the wake of the budget
   chaos, Truss refused to say that she did.

   After news broke Monday of Bowler’s appointment, No. 10
   officials insisted the decision was taken jointly by the PM and
   chancellor. While Truss rates Romeo highly, Bowler was judged to be the
   best person for the job given his Treasury background, according
   to government aides.

   The PM’s spokesman denied that the government was in chaos after the
   mini-budget, adding that Truss was “confident” in the measures she has
   announced to boost growth and support people through winter.

   Both Romeo, who runs the Ministry of Justice, and Bowler, who is the
   top official at the Department for International Trade, were well
   qualified for the position, as long-standing civil servants with
   experience running government departments.

   Some media reports suggested Romeo would not have been universally
   welcomed in the Treasury because she was seen as a disruptor. However,
   one senior Whitehall official said Romeo would have brought more drive
   and commercial experience than Bowler to the role. She has worked as a
   diplomat drumming up business for the U.K. in New York and set up the
   Department for International Trade, running it as permanent secretary
   for four years before Bowler took over last year.

   "It's a shame. Antonia would have brought a lot of energy, great drive
   and leadership, with a more commercial perspective," the official said.
   "James is a good guy, very sensible" and is embedded in "classic
   Treasury orthodoxy" due to his long career in the economic department,
   the official said. Bowler's record at the Treasury stretches back to
   2005, when he was principal private secretary to Labour's chancellor at
   the time, Gordon Brown.

   "Something strange seems to have happened. She was appointed and then
   not," said the senior official, who asked not to be named because they
   were not authorized to speak publicly. "Whether it's panic or not I
   don't know."

   In the official announcement, Kwarteng said he was “delighted to
   welcome James back to the Treasury.”

   The recruitment process was led by Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary,
   the country’s most senior, politically impartial official who is in
   charge of the civil service. Officially, he made the appointment, with
   the approval of Truss and the agreement of Kwarteng, according to the
   government’s press release.

   This article has been updated with more details, including the
   government statement confirming the announcement.
