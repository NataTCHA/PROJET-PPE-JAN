Outsider Theory

Intellectual Histories of Unorthodox Ideas

   2018
   •
   Author:

   Jonathan P. Eburne
   [mini]
   A vital and timely reminder that modern life owes as much to outlandish
   thinking as to dominant ideologies

   Outsider Theory is a timely book about outlandish ideas, bringing
   readers on an adventure in intellectual history that stresses the
   urgency of taking seriously ideas that might otherwise be regarded as
   errant, unfashionable, or even unreasonable. It shows how crucial it is
   to know how and why such ideas have left their impression on modern-day
   thinking and continue to shape its evolution.

   A bracing challenge to academic squeamishness, Outsider Theory is a
   learned, mischievous, and fascinating book that makes a compelling
   argument for the positive role of fraud, failure, and error in
   knowledge production. Outsider art, writing, and thinking can no longer
   be neatly quarantined in isolated and eccentric individuals, but must
   be recognized as thoroughly implicated in mass culture, scholarship,
   laboratory work, and critical theory.

   What do the Nag Hammadi library, Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code,
   speculative feminist historiography, Marcus Garvey’s finances, and maps
   drawn by asylum patients have in common? Jonathan P. Eburne explores
   this question as never before in Outsider Theory, a timely book about
   outlandish ideas. Eburne brings readers on an adventure in intellectual
   history that stresses the urgency of taking seriously—especially in an
   era of fake news—ideas that might otherwise be discarded or regarded as
   errant, unfashionable, or even unreasonable.



   Examining the role of such thinking in contemporary intellectual
   history, Eburne challenges the categorical demarcation of good ideas
   from flawed, wild, or bad ones, addressing the surprising extent to
   which speculative inquiry extends beyond the work of professional
   intellectuals to include that of nonprofessionals as well, whether
   amateurs, unfashionable observers, or the clinically insane.


   Considering the work of a variety of such figures—from popular occult
   writers and gnostics to so-called outsider artists and
   pseudoscientists—Eburne argues that an understanding of its circulation
   and recirculation is indispensable to the history of ideas. He devotes
   close attention to ideas and texts usually omitted from or marginalized
   within orthodox histories of literary modernism, critical theory, and
   continental philosophy, yet which have long garnered the critical
   attention of specialists in religion, science studies, critical race
   theory, and the history of the occult. In doing so he not only sheds
   new light on a fascinating body of creative thought but also proposes
   new approaches for situating contemporary humanities scholarship within
   the history of ideas.


   However important it might be to protect ourselves from “bad” ideas,
   Outsider Theory shows how crucial it is for us to know how and why such
   ideas have left their impression on modern-day thinking and continue to
   shape its evolution.

   Jonathan P. Eburne has written a generous, curious, rigorous book about
   ideas often dismissed as ridiculous, embarrassing, and even dangerous.
   Outsider Theory takes them seriously, which means subjecting them to
   the same caliber of historical analysis and philosophical critique
   usually reserved for ‘good’ ideas. In doing so, he launches us on
   several fascinating voyages across what he calls ‘the oceanic expanse
   of modern intellectual history.’

   Evan Kindley, author of Poet-Critics and the Administration of Culture

   This timely book is not only genuinely interesting, but makes a strong
   and original contribution to the discussion concerning the future of
   the humanities. Jonathan P. Eburne's study of questions of method is
   itself an achievement of method, engaging with the outsiders not as a
   cabinet of curiosities, but in a way that troubles thinking, and
   especially thinking about thinking.
