The Outsider: Consider yourself local? Have your say and vote

   whistleroutsidervote Time in the mountains can make you think... about
   who to vote for in the municipal election this Saturday, Oct. 15.Photo

   Like many international transplants, for the first 10 years of living
   in Whistler, I couldn’t vote in any of Canada’s elections. Not that it
   particularly bothered me, because I was all about having a good time:
   ski, bike, beer, repeat. Politics didn’t concern me, and I was
   blissfully ignorant of community concerns, provincial policies and
   federal funding.

   It took me about 10 years to gain my Certificate of Canadian
   Citizenship, which I still proudly display on my home office wall.
   Fellow seasonals-turned-lifers know all too well the length and
   bureaucratic hassle of that process; qualifying for one of Canada’s
   immigration programs, collecting written proof of jobs worked a decade
   ago, procuring criminal record checks from any country in which you
   spent more than a few months... I could fill this entire page with
   document checklists and proverbial hoops one needs to jump through in
   order to gain Permanent Residency (PR) status in Canada. And I think I
   can speak for every Permanent Resident when I say the effort is worth
   it. No more stress about work visas or whether you’ll need to exit the
   country at the end of the season. The PR milestone signifies the moment
   when you can genuinely lay your foundations in this country, this
   province and this community.

   But there’s one catch. PR doesn’t allow you to vote. For that
   constitutional right, you must get a passing score of 16/20 on your
   citizenship test and swear your allegiance to Canada and its (new)
   king. You don’t need to go to England or anything, you just need to
   stand in a room full of people in front of a judge, pledge your
   allegiance to this country and sing O Canada. This ceremony is a far
   less emotive affair in today’s Zoom version, but is still an
   unforgettable day in the lives of newly-naturalized Canadians.

   The biggest practical benefit of naturalization is being able to apply
   for a Canadian passport, so you no longer need to hold up your Canadian
   friends at the border on that road trip to the States. The biggest
   civic benefit of calling oneself Canadian? You guessed it.

   Voting in federal, provincial and (arguably most importantly) municipal
   elections.

   I’m not going to go into which council candidates support what and all
   the hot- button issues like housing, sustainability etc. since we’ve
   had plenty of that commentary already. What I will say is that some
   recreation-focused residents of Whistler sometimes forget that—for
   better or worse—political change affects us all. And yes, that applies
   at the local level.

   Let’s take a look at a few of the reasons Whistler residents may not
   vote, or more likely, just not bother.

I can’t vote because I’m not Canadian yet. I would if they allowed
non-Canadians to vote.

   Fair enough. I get the frustration of not being able to have your say
   when you’ve lived in Whistler for years, contributed to its economy and
   genuinely care about your community. But voting is a constitutional
   right reserved for those who have citizenship at birth or immigrants
   who run through the aforementioned process. Start yours now and you may
   get to vote in 2026.

There are so many candidates I can’t keep track. A lot of them are saying the
same thing: “we need more housing, yadda yadda.” How am I supposed to make an
informed vote?

   Yes, there are a lot of candidates. Some of them you may even know
   personally or professionally. The best resource is the paper in your
   hands. Pique’s reporters do a bang-up job of council and mayoral
   candidate profiles. G.D. Maxwell takes it a step further with his own
   endorsements. If you want to get a sense of everyone’s platform while
   say, washing the dishes, replay the Pique all-candidates meeting on
   your phone. It is three hours long, but you can skip around to the
   juicy parts.

Have you seen the weather this October? Screw the election, I’m going camping
this weekend.

   The strange and very welcomed sunny weather this October may well be
   the biggest contributor to a poor voter turnout on election day. But
   the future of your community shouldn’t take a backseat to one more
   great weekend of the seemingly endless summer of 2023. Advanced polling
   has been and gone, but General Voting Day kicks off at 8 a.m. on Oct.
   15 at Myrtle Philip Community School. So have your car packed the night
   before, wake up early and go vote. Put that on your Instagram stories
   before all your other weekend highlights.

   We have some solid incumbents running for re-election. Cathy Jewett and
   Jen Ford are the two I trust most to balance progress with the steady
   hand of experience. It’s great to see a bunch of younger candidates in
   the running, too, though not all seem to have done their homework. The
   one candidate I’ve seen present themselves with research and knowledge
   akin to more experienced councillors is Brendan Ladner, a.k.a. the
   “Skiable Future” guy. Yeah, the slogan is kinda tacky, but Ladner
   struck me as having a work ethic that matches his passion.

   As Pique editor Braden Dupuis wrote recently, “If you’re not actively
   involved, you get the policy you deserve. Simple as that.” That goes
   for all you skiers, bikers, hikers, skaters, softball leaguers,
   volleyball players and anyone else who prioritizes fun recreation over
   most other things in life. Real locals give a shit. So have your say on
   Saturday.

   Vince Shuley wants you to vote this Saturday, October 15. For
