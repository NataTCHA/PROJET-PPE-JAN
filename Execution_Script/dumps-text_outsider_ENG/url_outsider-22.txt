What is Outsider Art?

FREE Digital Issue:

   Raw Vision's
   100th Edition Magazine
   [RV100_480x480.png?v=1659553081]


   The controversy surrounding the exact definition of Outsider Art and
   allied fields has been going on ever since awareness of the phenomenon
   began so here we try to clarify the different aspects.

   The development of the awareness of forms of creative expression that
   exist outside accepted cultural norms, or the realm of “fine art”,
   began with the researches of psychiatrists early in the century.

   The work of Dr Morganthaler documented his patient Adolf Wolfli, a
   genius who produced countless thousands of works from a small cell in
   his Swiss asylum. Dr Hans Prinzhorn collected thousands of works by
   psychiatric patients and his book “Bildernerei der Geisteskranken”
   (Artistry of the Mentally Ill), published in 1922 became an influential
   work amongst Surrealist and other artists of the time.

   One artist who was particularly affected by the works Prinzhorn
   presented was Jean Dubuffet. Together with others, including Andre
   Breton, he formed the Compagnie de l’Art Brut in 1948 and strove to
   seek out and collect works of extreme individuality and inventiveness
   by creators who were not only untrained artists but often had little
   concept of an art gallery or even any other forms of art other than
   their own.

   Dubuffet’s concept of Art Brut was of works that were in their “raw”
   state, uncooked by cultural and artistic influences. He built up a vast
   collection of thousands of works, works which bore no relation to
   developments in contemporary art and yet were the innovative and
   powerful expressions of a wide range individuals from a variety of
   backgrounds.

ART BRUT


   Artworks by Johann Hauser and Aloise Corbaz

   Art Brut was Jean Dubuffet's original term for the works that he
   collected and revered; later adopted by the Collection de l'Art Brut at
   Lausanne. Art Brut means "raw art". Raw because it is "uncooked" or
   "unadulterated" by culture. Raw because it is creation in its most
   direct and uninhibited form. Not only were the works unique and
   original but their creators were seen to exist outside established
   culture and society. The purest of Art Brut creators would not consider
   themselves artists, nor would they even feel that they were producing
   art at all. Art Brut is visual creation at its purest – a spontaneous
   psychic flow from brain to surface. (examples: Aloïse Corbaz, Carlo
   Zinelli, Madge Gill, Johann Hauser, Adolf Wölfli)

OUTSIDER ART


   Artworks by Bill Traylor and Ferdinand Cheval

   The term "Outsider Art" was introduced as the title of Roger Cardinal's
   book in 1972 and was originally intended to act as an exact English
   equivalent to Dubuffet's term, although from the outset it encompassed
   not only Art Brut but also works in the Neuve Invention category Over
   the years it has been used increasingly loosely and can often now refer
   to any artist who is untrained or with disabilities or suffering social
   exclusion, whatever the nature of their work. (examples: Adolf Wölfli,
   Johann Hauser, Chomo, Bill Traylor, Frederich Schroder-Sonnenstern,
   Ferdinand Cheval, Simon Rodia)
     __________________________________________________________________

NEUVE INVENTION


   Artworks by Gaston Chaissac and Albert Louden

   Dubuffet realised that there existed many creators whose work was of
   comparable power and inventiveness to Art Brut, but their greater
   contact with normal society and the awareness they had of their art
   works precluded their inclusion within his strict Art Brut category.
   These creators were often humble workers who created in their spare
   time, or eccentric and untrained artists trying to make a living from
   their work – some of whom had dealings with commercial galleries. As an
   acknowledgement to them he formed his "Annex Collection"; in 1982 this
   became the Neuve Invention section of the Collection de l'Art Brut. As
   definitions become more merged this term is losing its significance.
   (examples: Gaston Chaissac, Mario Chichorro, Rosemarie Koczy, Gerard
   Lattier, Albert Louden, Frederich Schroder-Sonnenstern)

MARGINAL ART, ART SINGULIER


   Artworks by Danielle Jacqui and Ody Saban

   Marginal art (art singulier) is a term more used in Europe relating to
   the works of artists, usually, but not exclusively, self-taught, that
   are close to Art Brut and Outsider artists, both in appearance and
   directness of expression. These are the artists "on the margins", that
   grey area of definition that lies between Outsider Art and normal
   mainstream art, very similar to Dubuffet's Neuve Invention category.
   Art Singulier encompasses French marginal artists. (examples: Chomo,
   Danielle Jacqui, Raymond Reynaud, Ody Saban)

FOLK ART / CONTEMPORARY FOLK ART


   Artworks by William Edmondson and William L. Hawkins

   Folk art is a simple and direct term that has become much used in North
   America. Originally pertaining to the indigenous crafts and decorative
   skills of peasant communities in Europe, the term was later applied to
   the simply-made practical objects of colonial days – a combination of
   charm and practical craftsmanship. In contemporary terms, Folk Art can
   cover anything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings as well as
   the work of artists that would easily fall into the realm of Outsider
   Art. (examples: Sam Doyle, William Hawkins, William Edmondson, Mose
   Tolliver)
     __________________________________________________________________

SELF-TAUGHT ART


   Artworks by Thornton Dial and Mr. Imagination

   Self-taught art is a popular term in the United States which avoids the
   stigmas that some feel are attached to the Outsider Art definition.
   Many American artists are already pushed to the outer limits of society
   as a result of prejudice and feel this term offers more dignity.
   (examples: Mr Imagination, Thornton Dial)
     __________________________________________________________________

VISIONARY ART, INTUITIVE ART


   Artworks by Joe Coleman and Norbert Kox

   Visionary art and intuitive art are fairly general terms; used together
   they can include much urban folk art of the third world, as well as
   works based on religious experiences and visions. They are avoid the
   specifics of Outsider Art or Folk Art and can also be used in
   conjunction with "Self-Taught". (examples: Norbert Kox, Joe Coleman,
   Myrtice West, William Thomas Thompson, Donald Pass).
     __________________________________________________________________

NAïVE ART


   Artworks by John Kane and Ivan Generalic

   Naïve art refers to untrained artists who depict largely realistic
   scenes, often in skilled detail, with people, animals, and other
   aspects of the observed world, sometimes combined with fantasy images.
   They often aspire to normal artistic status and may often be seen as
   quite sophisticated amateurs verging on professionalism. (examples:
   Grandma Moses, John Kane, Ivan Generalic, Douanier Rousseau).
     __________________________________________________________________

VISIONARY ENVIRONMENTS


   Artworks by Simon Rodia and Nek Chand

   Visionary environments are spaces, buildings and sculpture parks built
   by intuitive artists almost defy definition. They have become known by
   various terms, Visionary Environments and Contemporary Folk Art
   Environments being perhaps the most appropriate in current use.
   Although Outsider Art has been used to describe the environments, some
   feel the label to be insulting to these particular creators, many of
   whom are integrated members of their local communities. Another popular
   term, especially in the US, is Grassroots Art, which can also cover the
   more humble expressions and constructions of ordinary folk in both town
   and country. (examples: Simon Rodia's Watts Towers, SP Dinsmoor's
   Garden of Eden, Ferdinand Cheval's Palais Ideal, Nek Chand's Rock
   Garden)
