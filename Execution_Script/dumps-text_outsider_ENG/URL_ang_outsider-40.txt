   outsider art, synonymous until the 1980s with art brut, any work of art
   produced by an untrained idiosyncratic artist who is typically
   unconnected to the conventional art world—not by choice but by
   circumstance. The “classic” figures of outsider art were socially or
   culturally marginal figures. They were usually undereducated; they
   almost invariably embraced unconventional views of the world, sometimes
   alien to the prevailing dominant culture; and many had been diagnosed
   as mentally ill. These people nevertheless produced—out of adversity
   and with no eye on fame or fortune—substantial high-quality artistic
   oeuvres.

Definition of terms

   Outsider art goes by many names, and the definition of terms is and has
   always been controversial. One of the most famous collections of this
   art, the Collection de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, Switz., was amassed by
   the French artist Jean Dubuffet, who is commonly regarded as a
   foundational figure.

   In the 1940s Dubuffet began collecting works of art made in unusual
   contexts. He considered these more authentic than the works of trained
   artists. In particular, he was intrigued by the art of psychiatric
   patients such as Heinrich Anton Müller, Aloïse Corbaz, and Carlo
   Zinelli; spiritualist mediums such as Augustin Lesage and Madge Gill;
   and other self-taught social isolates such as Gaston Chaissac and
   Scottie Wilson. For the art they produced, Dubuffet coined the term art
   brut (“raw” or “unrefined art”). In 1949 he wrote of his coinage:

     We understand by this term works produced by persons unscathed by
     artistic culture, where mimicry plays little or no part… These
     artists derive everything…from their own depths, and not from the
     conventions of classical or fashionable art. We are witness here to
     the completely pure artistic operation, raw, brute, and entirely
     reinvented in all of its phases solely by means of the artists’ own
     impulses.

   The term outsider art was introduced into the lexicon in 1972 by
   British writer Roger Cardinal as an English-language equivalent of the
   French art brut. By the 1980s, however, the term had expanded to
   encompass a much greater range of vernacular and “marginal” arts. This
   broadening was particularly important in the United States, where a
   rich vein of art that reflected racial, religious, and localized
   histories rather than psychiatric or spiritualist ones had grown
   independently from art brut. Known successively—and at times
   concurrently—as “popular painting,” “modern primitive art,”
   “self-taught art,” and “contemporary folk art,” works from the American
   scene were first made visible and analyzed in the 1930s by Museum of
   Modern Art (MoMA) curator and WPA Federal Art Project art director
   Holger Cahill, collector Sidney Janis, and others.

   Some of the first such American artists to be identified were Horace
   Pippin, John Kane, William Edmondson, and Morris Hirshfield. Although
   none of those artists conformed to the European idea of pathological
   artists, they were viewed in much the same way—as naïfs whose creative
   strength lay in some presumed innocence and authenticity, comparable to
   the European “Sacred Heart painters” such as Séraphine Louis and Louis
   Vivin. Later those Americans would be joined by others more closely
   conforming to Dubuffet’s “brut” definition, including Joseph Yoakum,
   Minnie Evans, Bill Traylor, James Castle, and, perhaps most famous of
   all, Henry Darger, a janitor from Chicago whose more-than-15,000-page
   illustrated novel In the Realms of the Unreal came to public notice
   only after his death. Outsider art further benefited from the addition
   at the end of the 20th century of figures such as the impressive fibre
   artist Judith Scott, who had Down syndrome and was deaf; Dwight
   Mackintosh, who was cognitively disabled and began drawing after his
   release from years of confinement in psychiatric hospitals; and Roy
   Wenzel, an autistic Dutch artist who developed a distinctive approach
   to colour and visual narrative.

History and characteristics

   Outsider art had its origins in the psychiatric collections of
   19th-century European psychiatric hospitals. The works in these
   collections were solicited from patients and organized for the purpose
   of medical teaching and analysis. About 1900 some psychiatrists and
   professional Modernist artists came to see such works not as medical
   evidence but as art. Two of the doctors produced early influential
   books on the subject: Swiss psychiatrist Walter Morgenthaler’s A Mental
   Patient as Artist (1921), which provided the first monograph of an
   outsider artist, Adolf Wölfli, a long-term patient whose oeuvre the
   Surrealist writer André Breton considered one of the three or four best
   of the 20th century; and the German psychiatrist and art historian Hans
   Prinzhorn’s Artistry of the Mentally Ill (1922), which became something
   of a touchstone for the Surrealists, especially Max Ernst, as well as
   for Dubuffet and subsequently many others.

   The artists Dubuffet chose to put in his category of art brut were
   socially marginalized—often denied not only their liberty but also
   their status as adults. Nevertheless, even the most distant of them—who
   were autistic or resided in other realities—did not create art out of
   nothing. For example, Wölfli and the Mexican artist Martín Ramírez, who
   had been held up as paragons of uninfluenced creativity, in fact had
   deep connections with culture outside the psychiatric hospital, both
   before and after their confinement, that were formative in their
   artwork and important aspects of its content. For other outsider
   artists, such as Howard Finster or Bill Traylor, it has long been
   agreed that content and context were uppermost in their work.
   Typically, the visual image was primarily a vehicle for the
   proselytizing and storytelling impulse of the artist.

   One of the threads connecting the groups within the outsider art
   category is the tendency of the artists to be “straight talking” (even
   if that talk is straight from a radically different worldview).
   Outsider art used to be seen as a kind of evolutionary prototype for
   much of Modernist practice, but, considered by itself, it was valued
   for its essential difference from that practice. By the early 2000s the
   work of outsiders could often look like an awkward version of what
   Dubuffet scathingly called the “usual art”—that is, the accepted and
   acceptable production of the contemporary mainstream. The confusion was
   more likely to result from “outsiderish” trends among trained artists
   than from any wish of outsiders to conform. Because outsider art tends
   to concern itself primarily with its message, the works often seemed
   more readily accessible and visually coherent to viewers than did those
   of the mainstream artists whose spaces it had begun to invade.

   While the Surrealists, according to their general practice of
   transgressing cultural boundaries, tended to show outsider art in the
   company of their own work, exhibitions of outsider art were otherwise
   restricted to specialist galleries and museums, such as the Collection
   de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, Switz.; the Aracine Musée d’Art Brut (Gagny)
   and the Musée de la Création Franche (Bègles) in France; and, in the
   United States, the American Folk Art Museum and the Galerie St.
   Etienne, both in New York City, and the Phyllis Kind Gallery in
   Chicago. Occasional outsider art exhibitions in mainstream galleries,
   such as Dubuffet’s 1967 "Art Brut" at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in
   Paris or the 1979 "Outsiders: An Art Without Precedence or Tradition"
   at the Hayward Gallery in London, only served to reinforce the sense of
   separation from the contemporary mainstream.

   A much-discussed exhibition of 2007 at the American Folk Art Museum and
   subsequently at the Milwaukee (Wis.) Art Museum showcased the work of
   Martín Ramírez (1895–1963), who worked entirely within the confines of
   the California psychiatric hospital where he was a patient for the
   greater part of his adult life. Though long known among those
   interested in outsider art, his works were thus introduced to a much
   wider U.S. audience. The New York Times described the exhibit as “one
   of the best shows of the season” and went so far as to declare Ramírez
   “one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.”

   The showing of Ramírez’s work confirmed a general move since the
   mid-1990s toward the wider acceptance of outsider art into mainstream
   galleries and museums and a recognition of its worthiness for serious
   art-world attention on its own terms. Other notable examples include
   exhibitions in 2005 at Kiasma, Helsinki’s museum of contemporary art,
   and at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. On the whole,
   however, outsider art continued to circulate among an international
   spread of specialist dealers, collectors, and galleries, and an annual
   New York Outsider Art Fair was established in 1992, attracting dealers
   from the United States, Europe, and Asia.

   A landmark exhibition of outsider, or “vernacular,” environments,
   “Sublime Spaces and Visionary Worlds,” was held in 2007–08 at the John
   Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wis. Such environments are an
   important part of the range of outsider art. Often significant in size
   and invariably the result of the compulsive vision and tireless work of
   a single individual (though occasionally helped by others later on),
   they can be found the world over. The best-known early example is
   Ferdinand Cheval’s Ideal Palace (built 1879–1912) in Hauterives,
   France. Other important environments include Sabato (Simon) Rodia’s
   Watts Towers in Los Angeles, Calif., Fred Smith’s Wisconsin Concrete
   Park in Phillips, Wis., Veijo Rönkkönen’s Sculpture Park in Parikkala,
   Finland, and Nek Chand’s Rock Garden in Chandigarh, India.
