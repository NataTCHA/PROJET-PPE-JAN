   NEW DELHI —

   China’s rulers are accusing "hostile forces," including foreigners, of
   inciting street demonstrations in more than three dozen Chinese cities
   and many more universities in the biggest domestic political challenge
--
   the protests are also considered adding fuel to the fire.

   “In this context, foreigners offering critical comments about the
   protests or making contacts with protesters are easily blamed for
   instigating, shaping and guiding the demonstrations,” he said.

   By blaming unrest on foreigners and foreign governments, analysts said,
   Beijing can whip up nationalist sentiments that weaken the protest
   movement.
