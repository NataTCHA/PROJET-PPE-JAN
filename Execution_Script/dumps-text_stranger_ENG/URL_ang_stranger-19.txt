   Some people can strike up a conversation with anyone—even complete
   strangers. But many others find it difficult to talk to a stranger.
   This can be particularly stressful if you have social anxiety disorder
   (SAD). But even if social small talk is hard for you, it is possible to
   improve your conversational skills and feel more comfortable talking
   with strangers. The best way to do this is to practice.

   Your initial goal is to make an introductory statement, which does not
   have to be complex. The point of that first comment is to open the
   door, and to give you the chance to say something else once the person
   responds.
   Starting a Conversation If You Have Social Anxiety

Comment on Something Personal

   You'll find that everyone you meet has something unique about
   them—an item of jewelry, an unusual shirt, or even a tattoo. These tell
   a story about a person. When you notice and compliment them, it can
   give you a starting point for conversation.

   For example, you could initiate a conversation by saying:
     * "Wow, that is a beautiful pendant. What kind of stone is that?"
     * "Nice shirt! You're a Grateful Dead fan?"
     * "Is that a tattoo of Yoda on your shoulder?"

   Avoid commenting on intimate aspects of a person's appearance, such as
   asking, "Is that your real hair color?" or "Wow, you must work out a
   lot!"

   After you receive a response, make sure you have something else to say.
   That will give you a common platform on which to build a conversation
   and, ultimately, a relationship with the person you've just met, even
   if the relationship only lasts a few minutes.

   Offer a follow-up story that reveals a bit of personal information
   about you. For example, when the person responds to your initial
   question, you could follow up with something like:
     * "I saw a pendant like that at a bazaar in India."
     * "My father was a real Deadhead. He took me to see them when I was a
       kid."
     * "I love tattoos. I've been thinking of getting one but I'm not sure
       what to get. How did you decide on Yoda?"

   These statements will help connect you to the person and keep the
   conversation moving. Remember, the goal is not to say the perfect thing
   or to come across a certain way, but to keep talking.
   How to Ask Small Talk Follow-Up Questions

Ask If You've Met Before

   This classic conversation starter can work in the right circumstances.
   If you say to someone, "You seem really familiar, do I know you from
   somewhere?" it makes it easier to gather and give information and keep
   a conversation going.

   For example, if you ask someone where they went to high school and it
   turns out you went to the same school, you could follow up by offering
   a fact like, "I was in the marching band. Did you play an instrument?"

   If you ask someone where they work and realize that you have seen them
   there, it gives you the opportunity to make a connection: "I love that
   Starbucks!"

   As the other person is giving information about themselves to you, it's
   OK to go off on interesting tangents. Remember: the goal is not to find
   out if you've met before, it's to get to know the other person.

Break the Ice With Humor

   Another great way to start a conversation with the people around you is
   to simply comment on your shared surroundings. A little humor works
   great here.

   For example, if you are sitting in a lecture hall and notice that your
   professor looks familiar, you could say to the person next to you,
   "Doesn't he look a bit like Harry Potter?"

   Keep your commentary positive—never mean-spirited or judgmental. You
   want the other person to feel comfortable getting in on the joke with
   you. You could follow up on your previous comment about your professor
   with something like, "I wonder where Hedwig is?"

   Humor is difficult with someone you don't know well, which means using
   this method to start a conversation can be risky. However, if you do
   find someone who shares your sense of humor, it can be the start of a
   great friendship.

   If you don't receive a positive response from one person, the method
   might work with someone else. The more you practice, the easier it will
   be to talk to a person you don't know. With time, you'll become more
   confident and won't need to rely on tricks to get a conversation
   started and keep it going.
   Small Talk Topics

Keep the Conversation Going

   You might participate less in a conversation because your anxiety makes
   you too uncomfortable and self-conscious or because you don't have
   experience making conversation. But a 2016 study showed that people
   with social anxiety tend not to contribute equally to conversations. As
   a result, they are less well-liked than others.

   So it's important to hold up your end of a conversation once you start
   it. Many people can do this with people they know, but they are
   self-conscious with strangers. Their anxiety holds them back and
   prevents them from being their true selves.

Cope With Conversation Challenges

   Lacking certain social skills can inhibit your ability to engage others
   in conversation, especially if it makes you seem unfriendly. For
   example, research shows that people with social anxiety tend to make
   less eye contact during conversation.

   Working on making and keeping eye contact when you are talking to
   others will help you appear more approachable and friendly. This will
   make it more likely people will respond to your attempts to start a
   conversation.

   If you feel that you don't have the social skills and experience needed
   to be a good conversationalist, self-help books and working with a
   therapist can help you develop them.

   While it's important not to avoid conversations with strangers because
   they make you feel anxious, your safety also matters. Practice talking
   to strangers in safe, public environments where the stakes are low. And
   if you are chatting with someone online, always protect your personal
   information.

A Word From Verywell

   Strategies for starting a conversation and being more comfortable
   around others will work best if you are able to work on and manage your
   underlying anxiety. With time, practice, and the right treatment, you
   can gain confidence and improve your conversation skills. If you have
   social anxiety, you might find that treatment with cognitive-behavioral
   therapy or medication helps you feel more at ease in social settings.
