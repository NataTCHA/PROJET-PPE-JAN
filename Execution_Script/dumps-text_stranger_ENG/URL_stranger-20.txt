Stranger Danger

Who is a Stranger?

     * A stranger is anyone you don't know.
     * Strangers can be men, women or teenagers.
     * If you have never met them before, they are strangers!
     * Although there are kind strangers, some strangers are not always
       kind and some can hurt you.
     * There is no way to tell if someone is good just by looking at them.
       Bad people can pretend to be nice too.
     * Don't be fooled! Just stay away.

When a Stranger tries to talk to you

     * Do not look at them or acknowledge that they have spoken to you,
       ignore them.
     * Walk quickly or run away from them in the opposite direction as
       fast as you can.
     * Go to a home of someone you know or to an area that has a lot of
       people.
     * Tell an adult you can trust about what happened, like a parent, a
       teacher, a police officer, or some other grownup your parents said
       you can talk to.

Keeping Safe Tips

     * Always tell your parents where you are going.
     * Try not to walk anywhere alone. Walk with a friend or two.
     * Don't take shortcuts through the woods or empty lots.
     * Do not get close to strangers. Make sure you have room to run.
     * Don't tell your name or address to a stranger.
     * Know how and when to call 9-1-1.
     * Never open the door to a stranger.
     * Never tell anyone on the phone you are alone.
     * Never take candy, money or gifts from a stranger.
     * Never go with a stranger to help look for a lost pet or play a
       game.
     * Never get into a car with anyone you don't know.
     * If a stranger follows you or grabs for you, yell really loud.
       Shout, "I don't know you," so other people know you are in trouble.
       Fight back and make as much noise as you can.
     * If anyone touches you in a bad way, say "NO" as loudly as you can
       and run away. Tell an adult immediately.
     * Talk to your parents and come up with a secret code word for
       emergencies

When you are at home alone

     * Keep all the doors and windows locked and don't let anyone know you
       are home alone.
     * If someone rings your doorbell, look through a peephole or window
       to see who it is. If you do not recognize them, don't open the
       door! Even if they are saying it is an emergency and they need to
       use to phone or come inside, do not open the door.
     * If someone calls and asks for your parents, do not tell them you
       are home alone. Tell the person your mom or dad can't come to the
       phone right now, but you will take a message and they will return
       the call later. Tell them this even if your parent(s) is gone for
       an hour or more. If you have caller ID and do not recognize the
       name or phone number on the phone, don't answer it.

Stranger Tricks

   Strangers who are bad people and want to hurt you have developed some
   pretty tricky things to do to confuse you and get you alone with them.
     * First, there is the "Help Trick". This is when a stranger asks you
       to help them find a lost pet or maybe asks you for directions to
       get somewhere.
     * The next trick is called the "Emergency Trick". A stranger will
       tell you that there is an emergency in your family and your mom or
       dad asked them to get you. The stranger may even say that your mom
       or dad got hurt.
     * Another trick strangers try is the "Accident Trick". This is when a
       stranger lays on the ground and looks like they have been injured,
       are unconscious, or in pain. Do not go over to the person! They can
       grab you and take you away. Instead, go to someone you know and
       tell them or call 911 for help.
     * The "Animal Trick" is another one that is hard to resist. This is
       when a stranger holds a small animal and invites you to pet it. You
       are close enough for this stranger to discard the animal and grab
       you.
     * The last is called the "Bribe Trick". This is when a stranger
       promises you candy, money or something else of interest. People do
       not give gifts to people they do not know.
