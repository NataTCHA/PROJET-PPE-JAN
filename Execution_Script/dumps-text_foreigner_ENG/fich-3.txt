   Foreigners will be able to holiday in Japan again from October

   Japan will open its doors back up to foreign tourists, after more than
   two years of closed borders due to the Covid pandemic.

   Tourists will be able to visit the country without a visa, and will no
   longer need to go through a travel agency, from 11 October.

   A cap on daily arrivals will also be lifted.

   Japan's announcement comes at around the same time Taiwan and Hong Kong
   also relaxed entry rules for visitors.

   Taiwan will drop quarantine requirements for international arrivals by
   mid-October, while Hong Kong on Friday said it would move from hotel
   quarantine to stay-at-home requirements from 26 September.

   For Japan, the anticipated influx of travellers will be a welcome boost
   to government and local businesses, and comes as the Japanese yen has
   slid to its slowest point against the US dollar in six months.

   "Japan will relax border control measures to be on par with the US,"
   said Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

   The country has allowed visitors since June, but they had to be part of
   tours.

   Mr Kishida also announced a domestic travel incentive scheme that will
   give discounts on travel, theme park prices, sporting events and
   concerts. Japanese residents and citizens will be eligible for a 11,000
   yen (£69; $77) subsidy.

   Similar programmes have been introduced in other countries' re-openings
   to encourage locals to spend and stimulate the economy. However, like
   elsewhere, the rise in cost of living has been a dominant concern for
   locals.

   The world's third-largest economy was one of the last Asian powerhouses
   to keep its borders closed due to Covid health concerns.

   Its death rate is the lowest among the world's wealthiest nations,
   while the country's vaccination rate is among the highest.

   Japan also never mandated lockdowns or mask wearing, but many locals
   readily adopted protections.

   Japan saw nearly 32 million foreigners visit in 2019, the last year
   prior to the pandemic. And the restrictions on travellers in recent
   months had precluded many foreigners from visiting, reports showed.
