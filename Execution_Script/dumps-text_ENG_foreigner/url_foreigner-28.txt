   NEW DELHI —

   China’s rulers are accusing "hostile forces," including foreigners, of
   inciting street demonstrations in more than three dozen Chinese cities
   and many more universities in the biggest domestic political challenge
   for Beijing since 1989's Tiananmen Square protests.

   At stake is the legitimacy of the ruling Chinese Communist Party as
   protesters question its management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   government has used repressive methods such as repetitive mass testing,
   quarantines, and lockdowns resulting in large-scale unemployment and
   economic loss.

   Jolted, the government is handling the new situation cautiously. Though
   several instances of police violence have taken place, state repression
   has not reached the magnitude initially feared. The government is
   depending more on propaganda to evoke nationalistic sentiments and
   using politically divisive methods to address some of the problems
   highlighted by protesters, according to analysts.

   “We must resolutely crack down on infiltration and sabotage activities
   by hostile forces in accordance with the law, resolutely crack down on
   illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order and effectively
   maintain overall social stability," the CCP's Central Political and
   Legal Affairs Commission (CPLAC) said in a statement released Tuesday.

   Bucknell University political scientist Zhiqun Zhu said the statement
   is a direct reference to foreign forces attempting to fan the flames of
   political unrest.

   “The definitions of 'infiltration' and 'sabotage activities' are very
   broad. Even a foreign journalist reporting on site is viewed with
   suspicion," Zhu told VOA. "Social media postings and commentaries on
   the protests are also considered adding fuel to the fire.

   “In this context, foreigners offering critical comments about the
   protests or making contacts with protesters are easily blamed for
   instigating, shaping and guiding the demonstrations,” he said.

   By blaming unrest on foreigners and foreign governments, analysts said,
   Beijing can whip up nationalist sentiments that weaken the protest
   movement.

   An estimated 43 protests across 22 Chinese cities unfolded between
   Saturday and Monday, according to the Canberra-based Australian
   Strategic Policy Institute, and some analysts say the protests have
   since spread to more cities and towns.

   China's leadership is trying to meet some protest demands to lift
   COVID-19 requirements such as lockdowns, mass testing and quarantines,
   and several locked-down areas and restaurants in the southern Chinese
   city of Guangzhou — a manufacturing hub hit hard by the latest COVID-19
   outbreaks — reopened Wednesday.

   “I believe that in the next few days most of the locked-down areas
   across China will be reopened,” Hu Xijin, former editor in chief of the
   Global Times and a strong Communist Party voice, said in a video
   statement on the paper’s website.

   Hu indicated this would likely be done to maintain social stability.
   “As lockdowns are coming to an end, the biggest factor for public
   discontent will be eliminated. It will have a very positive effect on
   maintaining social stability,” he said.

   Instead of using batons to keep protesters in line — a normal strategy
   for Chinese riot officers — police are busy identifying possible rebels
   and troublemakers and checking phones to find out whether they have
   been circulating protest images on virtual private networks and
   accessing banned sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

   Tuesday's statement by CPLAC said agency officials had emphasized that
   "political and legal organs must take effective measures to …
   resolutely safeguard national security and social stability."

   Will protests persist?

   Analysts differ on whether the protests — which are demanding
   democratic freedoms and an end to censorship — are likely to continue.

   “It is unlikely that there will be more large-scale protests in the
   near future,” Zhu said. “New policies are being rolled out to loosen
   COVID-19 controls. It is also expected that the ‘zero-COVID' policy
   will be replaced by more scientific and pragmatic measures,” he said.

   Others disagree.

   “More protests will emerge in different parts of China in the coming
   days, although the authorities may try to suppress them," said
   Jagannath Panda, head of the Stockholm Center for South Asian and
   Indo-Pacific affairs at the Institute for Security and Development
   Policy in Sweden. "The Communist Party’s image has taken a severe
   beating because of widespread unemployment and the government’s
   repression.”

   Salih Hudayar, an activist leader of the Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang,
   said China might even use the military to suppress the protest
   movement. The suppression of Uyghurs has drawn the attention of human
   rights activists and several foreign governments.

   “The Chinese government has already started to crack down on the
   protests by intimidating protesters and arresting many of them,” said
   Hudayar, prime minister of the self-styled East Turkistan Government in
   Exile.

   “Because there is not any meaningful political support from the
   international community, it's highly likely that the Chinese government
   will use military force to suppress the protests in the coming weeks,
   if not days,” he said.
