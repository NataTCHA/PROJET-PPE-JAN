   National Sit with a Stranger Day is observed on September 16 of each
   year in the U.S. The day was created in a bid to encourage people of
   all ages and gender to strike up a conversation with a random stranger
   for the sole purpose of seeing things from the perspective of others.

   In an era where lockdowns have become the norm, National Sit with a
   Stranger Day was created by the B.DOPE L.L.C. team, a bottled water
   company that is creating a catalyst for optimism, encouragement, and
   relationships. The day presents a splendid opportunity to start a
   random, friendly conversation with someone and make a new connection.

History of National Sit With a Stranger Day

   A stranger is generally portrayed as an outsider and a figure of
   uncertainty because they could be a friend, an enemy, or both. This
   makes them a potential source of conflict. The origin of the word
   ‘stranger’ can be traced back to the Middle French word ‘estrangier,’
   which meant a foreigner or an alien.

   The term ‘strangers’ was first used about the time that the textile
   industry was beginning to flourish in the 15th century. This was the
   oldest known instance of its use. Strong trading linkages and
   relatively unnoticed immigration caused several settlements to relocate
   from one location to another in pursuit of greener pastures. By the
   16th century, new European areas like the Netherlands, Belgium, and
   France had begun to create goods that were both cheaper and of a higher
   quality than those produced in older European nations.

   Because of this, another migration took place, during which skilled
   immigrants moved to areas that were abundant in textile materials and
   began instructing local employees on how to manufacture new sorts of
   cloth. The high level of workmanship and originality displayed by the
   skilled immigrants prompted city authorities in England to write a
   letter to Queen Elizabeth I pleading for the monarch’s authorization to
   allow immigrant workers to permanently stay in England. In addition,
   the political climate in Spain at the time was hostile against
   Protestants, which led thousands of people to leave the country in
   search of religious freedom in other countries.

   In the year 1565, the city of Norwich granted permission to Protestant
   refugees from the Spanish Netherlands to settle so that they could help
   the city’s textile industry. The rapid expansion of the ‘stranger’
   community led to the city of Norwich having over 4,000 Dutch and
   Walloon residents by the year 1620. This represented approximately
   one-fourth of the whole population of the city and led to an
   astronomical increase in England’s economic value.

National Sit With a Stranger Day FAQs

What does it mean when you meet a stranger?

   If you meet someone, you happen to be in the same place as them and
   start talking to them. You may know the other person, but be surprised
   to see them, or you may not know them at all.

How do you safely meet a stranger?

   If you’re planning to meet a stranger for the first time, the first
   step is to stay in communication with someone you know about who you’re
   meeting and where you will be meeting the stranger. If possible, ensure
   your first meeting is in a public place. If you don’t feel very
   comfortable going alone, you can take a friend who can live once it’s
   safe.

How do you talk to a stranger without being awkward?

   To easily engage in conversation, you have to be brave and try not to
   overthink or micro-analyze things. Ask genuine questions and throw in a
   compliment when necessary. Focus on things you both have in common and
   try not to let awkward moments ruin the flow.

National Sit With a Stranger Day Activities

    1.

Visit a public spot
       Find a spot in a park or another public place and take a seat. If
       there's someone nearby, say hello and see if they want to chat. If
       not, enjoy some peace and quiet.
    2.

Join a social conversation
       Join a meetup group or online forum that focuses on meeting new
       people. Attend an event or check out the conversation threads to
       find someone to chat with.
    3.

Make a random connection
       Strike up a conversation with the person sitting next to you on the
       bus, train, or in line at the grocery store. Small talk can be a
       great way to break the ice and get to know someone a little better.

5 Facts About Immigration That Are Mind-Blowing

    1.

There are more immigrant men than women
       Men tend to migrate far more easily due to financial duties, and a
       man will frequently travel to seek better pastures or a means to
       meet family obligations.
    2.

Immigration raises economic output
       According to analysts, foreign-born workers contribute almost two
       trillion dollars to the yearly G.D.P.
    3.

American immigrants are majorly Latino or Asian
       While there is still significant European migration to America,
       approximately 80% of U.S. immigrants are from Latin America and
       Asia.
    4.

The 19th Century saw massive migration
       Based on the current global population, more individuals were
       moving during the end of the 19th century than at present.
    5.

The first green card had green stripes
       The first 'green card,' issued in the 1950s following World War II,
       was a war form printed on green paper.
