   An 82-year-old Walmart worker, who had just $50 in her bank account and
   moves around with a cane, was gifted more than $130,000 from
   kind-hearted strangers.

   Carman Kelly, 82, of Arizona, has worked at the Apache Junction Walmart
   for a little over two years to help fund her hefty medical bills.

   'Well, I was in the emergency room a few times and I ran out of money,'
   she told News 12, laughing. 'My life has been up and down, up and down.
   They say these are the golden years, but what's golden about them?'

   'My Walmart money, it helped me pay for food and gas and other things,'
   she told Good Morning America (GMA).

   Carman's world got a lot more golden after she met Liz Rizzo, who was
   shopping at the store and noticed the Walmart greeter was leaning on a
   shopping cart with a cane in the basket.

   'When I saw her when I walked in the door, my heart just cracked open,'
   Liz told the news outlet. 'The seniors in the world need to be taken
   care of because they took care of us.'

   In the TikTok, which has been viewed 15.5million times, Liz asked the
   friendly Walmart associate if she 'needed to work here.'

   Carman sadly answered: 'Yeah.' And when asked why Walmart didn't
   provide her with a chair, she told Liz: 'No need, I have this,'
   indicating to her shopping cart.

   According to several employees Liz talked to, the company's policy
   states employees cannot sit throughout their shifts.

   However, Walmart said in a statement to AZ Family that it 'honors
   reasonable accommodations' and has a 'long history of working with
   associates with disabilities.'

   Liz started a GoFundMe for Carman, setting the goal at $10,000 - the
   total amount of her medical bills - which they originally thought would
   never be met. But much to Carman and Liz's surprise, the fundraiser has
   raised more than $133,000 in two weeks.

   When she started the fundraiser for Carman, she had no idea the older
   woman had only $50 in her bank account, which she said would 'last her
   until next week.'

   Now, the $133,000 will go into a trust, according to Liz, to make sure
   the money goes directly to Carman. The 82-year-old and her family are
   also working with a financial advisor to help deal with the large sum
   of money.

     THE POWER OF PEOPLE❤️
     Liz Rizzo didn't know Carman Kelly, the 82yo Walmart greeter who
     donned a cane & a smile as she walked in.
     But Liz couldn't help but wonder why was Carman still working?

   Carman is 'hoping' to retire after receiving the money, which she is
   expected to receive before the new year, and called Liz her 'guardian
   angel'

   Carman is expected to receive the money before the new year.

   In an update video, Carman thanked the strangers who helped her and
   said she 'hoped' to retire after using the money to pay off her medical
   bills.

   'My life is going to change so much,' Carman told News 12. 'It is a
   miracle. I can't thank you enough,' she told Liz, who she calls her
   'guardian angel.'

   'I mean, she was a total stranger to me and it's like God sent her to
   me. And I really feel that way because she has been absolutely
   wonderful,' she told GMA.

   'This will be the golden years for me!' she told News 12 with a bright
   smile on her face.

   Carman plans on moving out of her current home and going into assisted
   living to help her when she falls after she receives the money.

   As for Liz, she's still shocked by how far her TikTok reached and is
   now encouraging others to 'be kind.'

   'My main purpose in this whole thing is to inspire others to do what
   I've done,' she told GMA. 'Just go out and help someone. You don't have
   to do a fundraiser. You can do anything.'
