   BAGHDAD —

   Assailants fatally shot an American aid worker Monday in a rare killing
   of a foreigner in the Iraqi capital in recent years, two police
   officials said.

   The man was shot in his car as he entered the street where he lives in
   Baghdad’s central Karada district on the east bank of the Tigris River
   but the reason for the killing was not immediately clear, they said.
   They said the man’s wife and child were in the car with him but were
   not hurt.

   The officials said as the man drove down his street, a car cut him off
   and assailants in another car shot him. It was not immediately clear if
   the assailants were trying to kidnap the man, they said.

   State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters that the department
   is aware of the reports of the killing of a U.S. aid worker in Baghdad
   and is looking into them. But, he said the department was not yet in a
   position to confirm the accounts of the death or that the person was a
   U.S. citizen.

   According to documents seen by the Associated Press, the man had been
   renting an apartment in Karada’s Wahda area since May last year.

   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killing.

   U.S. Embassy officials could not immediately provide any information
   about the case.

   Two security officials confirmed a U.S. citizen who worked for an
   international aid organization had been killed without giving his name.
   They said details were scarce but an investigation was underway. The
   officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

   A medical worker at Sheikh Zayed Hospital, where the victim was taken,
   said he was dead on arrival.

   Prime Minister Mohammed Sudani said he would form a committee
   comprising the Interior Ministry and various security agencies to
   “investigate the circumstances of the killing of an American citizen in
   the capital.”

   The streets of the middle class, mixed Christian and Muslim
   neighborhood where the victim reportedly lived were empty of residents
   but heavily patrolled by police Monday night.

   Such attacks against individuals in the Iraqi capital have been rare
   since the defeat of the Islamic State group in the country in 2017 but
   rockets are sometimes fired toward the U.S. Embassy.

   In the early years that followed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003,
   such attacks were common. In 2004, two Americans were kidnapped in
   Baghdad and extremists later released videos showing their beheading.

   The attack came after Iraq’s new Cabinet headed by Sudani was given a
   vote of confidence by parliament in late October. Sudani was named by
   the Iran-backed Coordination Framework, composed largely of Shiite
   parties.

   Iraq held early elections more than a year ago in response to mass
   anti-government protests that began in October 2019 in Baghdad and
   spread across southern Iraq. Protesters called for the overhaul of the
   political system established after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.

   U.S.-led coalition forces recently ended their combat mission in Iraq
   but continue to play an advisory role to Iraqi forces in the fight
   against Islamic State.

   Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this
   report.
