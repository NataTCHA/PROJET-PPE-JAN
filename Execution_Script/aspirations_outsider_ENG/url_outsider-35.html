At BMO Field in Toronto, the Canada men’s team had just come back to beat Panama 4-1 on the sixth matchday of CONCACAF  qualifying with an entertaining, full-throttle approach. Qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1986 began to look like a possibility. Advertisement With the sun starting to appear, Ugbo, 24, decided he wanted in on the experience. He fired off a text message to Canada centre-back Doneil Henry – five years Ugbo’s senior, but a familiar face because the two had grown up five minutes apart in Brampton, Ontario. “He was megging me when I was in grade five, and we used to beat him up,” said Henry, with a smile. Ugbo asked Henry how he could get involved in the  team. A talented product of the Chelsea academy, Ugbo had bounced around on loan deals, leading to questions about his long-term potential. Henry posed a question of his own in response to Ugbo’s text: Do you have the right mentality to play on this team? Ugbo insisted he did, so Henry passed the message over to Canada head coach John Herdman. Herdman had inquired about Ugbo’s availability to play for Canada early in his tenure as head coach, but was told by Chelsea staff that Ugbo was only interested in representing  after playing for several of their youth national teams. Still, Ugbo remained eligible to play for Canada. And as a vital forward in an attack-minded Canada squad, the World Cup could finally be the time for the AC Troyes man, long considered an outsider in Chelsea’s ranks and whose career has taken winding turns, to deliver on years of promise, and carve out a place for himself. When Ugbo closed his eyes and thought about being four years old and playing soccer in Brampton, two images came to mind. “Scoring a lot of goals,” he said with a smile. “And, our jerseys were sponsored by Tim Hortons.” Born in London, Ugbo moved to Canada with his mother and sisters while still in preschool. His father remained in the UK to work, but traveled between the two countries often. When his father was with him, he would regale his son with stories of the Nigeria team at the 1994 World Cup, who topped their group. Advertisement As fate would have it, his family had moved to what would eventually become the soccer capital of Canada, home to some of the country’s best players,  including , ,  and, of course, Henry. “When I look back, I can see how much growth Canada has had, and how far Canada has come to where we are today,” said Ugbo. Eventually, the distance between the family became too great and Ugbo, then nine, and his family returned to England. Ugbo began playing recreationally there, but readily admits that, having grown up in Canada, he failed to understand just how deeply entrenched soccer is in England’s national psyche. Read more: After a few months playing as a midfielder in a friendly Sunday league, Ugbo was approached by a Chelsea scout offering a chance to train at their academy. “At the time, I didn’t see it as big as it was,” he said. He was playing as a No. 10, but after changes in the squad forced him to move to striker as a 16-year-old, he was able to stay in the position because of his natural instincts for finishing. “You learn different types of movements needed,” said Ugbo. “When I made the transition, I brought things that I had to use while playing in midfield. It just clicks well.” For the majority of his time in the Chelsea academy, highlighted by UEFA Youth League titles in 2015 and 2016, things clicked for him. He signed his first professional contract with Chelsea in 2015. But almost immediately, his eyes became bigger than his stomach. As a 17-year-old he thought, I have to play first team football as soon as possible. “I was ready to learn everything from a young age, including the difficulties,” he said. Joining a Chelsea first team with  and  title aspirations wasn’t possible. His father wanted him to get outside of his comfort zone and go abroad. Instead, Ugbo went on loan with Barnsley in the EFL Championship. Regular playing time and goals did not come. The same was the case for his loan to League One side MK Dons for the second half of the 2017-18 season, as well as his loan to another League One side, Scunthorpe United, for 2018-19. Advertisement He had rushed into his professional career, scoring just five goals across those three teams in his two seasons on loan. “It looked like maybe I wasn’t ready, and you could say that,” Ugbo said. “I was still a kid. I had to learn fast.” This shock was coupled with living away from home for the first time, and the new responsibilities he had to learn — be it maintaining a clean apartment or eating healthy. He struggled with the latter, to the point that it negatively impacted his performances. “Your body is asking for more than in Under-23’s football because the intensity is even higher,” he said. “It was a real shock to me at the time.” During his scoring drought and frequent moves, he wondered whether he’d succeed as a professional soccer player. “Sometimes there were doubts through the first two loans, for sure,” he said. “Like, ‘Where’s my level?’” Conversations with those closest to him all eventually came to the same conclusion: the teams he was trying to crack would not change their approach to fit Ugbo. Instead, he needed to better understand his surroundings. “You have to be quicker at adapting to the team’s tactics,” he said of what he learned through his first few failed loan spells. “I don’t think many coaches will change the tactics for you.” He employed that mentality when he finally did get out of his comfort zone with a loan to JC Roda in the Dutch second division. His 13 goals in 28 league matches bolstered his confidence through the 2019-20 season, as did the 16 goals he scored in 32 matches on loan in Belgium’s top flight with Cercle Brugge. He now had the belief instilled in him from Cercle Brugge head coach (and former Chelsea assistant) Paul Clement of his potential as a scorer in a European top flight. Ugbo found himself asking more questions of Clement than he ever had of any previous manager to better understand how he could be effective. Advertisement The conclusion of the 2020-21 season brought the end of Ugbo’s Chelsea contract. But for the first time in his career he had the confidence and agency over his career that he never did while bouncing from loan move to loan move. Ugbo had finally learned what qualities made him his most dangerous on the pitch. “A nuisance,” he said. “Being everywhere and being clinical. Not needing many chances, just one or two, to score. That’s when I’m at best.” Ugbo’s goal-scoring put him on the radar of multiple national teams. In September 2021, as Ugbo was beginning to find the back of the net with Genk on a new permanent deal in the Belgian first division, he publicly stated that he would represent Nigeria. The chance to play in the 2022 World Cup was a driving factor. Quietly, Ugbo still hesitated with his decision. He says now that he never heard from then-Nigeria national team coach Gernot Rohr throughout the process. “And,” he added, “I never grew up in Nigeria, either.” His first conversation with Herdman in October 2021 changed everything. “(Herdman) knew about me from when I was at Chelsea,” Ugbo said. “He knew exactly what I was going through. He spoke to me about the ambitions of Canada and what he’s trying to do and what he’d already done. Already I could see, without him telling me, the direction Canada was going in.” The Canada national team’s upward trajectory matched his own. He committed to Canada just before they departed for Edmonton and earned two crucial wins in November 2021 against  and  to go to the top of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying table. “He adapted well, right when he came on the team,” said fellow Canada forward . This includes connecting with teammates about fashion, which he sees as an outlet to express his personality. During the team’s June camp in Vancouver, Henry took Ugbo to some of his favourite clothing spots on Robson Street. Henry’s guidance helped turn Ugbo on to new designers. Advertisement But even Henry, who takes more fashion risks than his teammates, was taken aback. “Some of the things that he would wear, I would never wear,” Henry said, cracking a quick smile. “It’s just offside for me.” During the June camp, Ugbo gained enough confidence to start imparting some of his own personality on other teammates – for example, having noticed that Cavallini’s Spotify playlists relied too heavily on reggaeton, Ugbo grabbed Cavallini’s phone and added more American hip-hop to the mix in this past June’s international window. “He introduced me to some artists that I never used to listen to,” said Cavallini, “but now he’s got me hooked on them.” Ugbo is also making an impression on the pitch. He can use his instincts to quickly get inside of defenders before using his strength to maintain that positioning. Crucially, he can be a clinical finisher close to goal. “(Ugbo) always finds himself in the right situations,” said Canada teammate . “When his back is against the goal, he’s very good at holding the ball up, twisting, turning in and finding his way out.” But in a World Cup year, Ugbo’s potential is hardly as important as his current output. It took longer than Ugbo wanted to sign a permanent deal with Troyes ahead of this season, which cut into his pre-season and training camp. He looked sluggish, playing with a heavy touch early in the season. Ugbo only began to move more fluidly and find more scoring opportunities in September. Ugbo’s next step will be taking on more of a prominent role in the Canada team and extinguishing that outsider tag once and for all. “I think that can only be established through performance,” Herdman told The Athletic. “(He) would probably walk into another position on the field, but in that forward line with Jonathan David, , ,  and Tajon Buchanan, that’s a tough group to break. So with Ike, it’s about a massive season for Troyes.” Still, there is a potential window of opportunity for Ugbo to make a mark. Cavallini occupies a similar No. 9 role as Ugbo, but with his Vancouver Whitecaps falling short of the  playoffs, Cavallini didn’t get regular playing time heading into the World Cup. Larin is Canada’s all-time leading scorer, but regular minutes at Club Brugge have been few and far between. Then there is the matter of tactical flexibility, something Herdman demanded of the 10 forwards he invited to Canada’s September camp. Could Ugbo adapt to a new role, as opposed to a typical goal-front poacher for Canada? Will that be the final step to him earning a start at the World Cup? Ugbo sincerely hopes so. “The performances in your club team, especially for me, it’s just about goals and assists, making sure I’m performing on a regular basis, no matter the team,” said Ugbo. He spoke in a more serious tone, before his child-like smile appeared again. After bouncing around for most of his career, ahead of the World Cup, he’s finally found where he can have the most important impact of his career to date. “I feel this (Canada’s national team) is where I belong.” Read more: (Photo: Perry vd Leuvert/BSR Agency/Getty Images)","description":"The Chelsea academy product has fit right in to John Herdman's team, but faces long odds for significant minutes in Qatar","headline":"England-born Ike Ugbo hoping to shed ‘outsider’ label with goals for Canada","isAccessibleForFree":false,"mainEntityOfPage":"https://theathletic.com/3795730/2022/11/14/ike-ugbo-canada-world-cup/","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Athletic","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","height":60,"url":"https://theathletic.com/app/themes/athletic/assets/img/the-athletic-wordmark-black.png","width":435}},"url":"https://theathletic.com/3795730/2022/11/14/ike-ugbo-canada-world-cup/","articleSection":"Soccer","keywords":["Chelsea","Canada","Soccer","World Cup"],"hasPart":{"@type":"WebPageElement","isAccessibleForFree":false,"cssSelector":".paywall-content"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/10200550/GettyImages-1358550908.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/10200550/GettyImages-1358550908.jpg"}</script><link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.theathletic.com"/><link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.transcend.io"/><link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://cdn.theathletic.com"/><link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://cdn.transcend.io"/><link rel="preload" as="image" imagesrcset="https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,format=auto/https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/10200550/GettyImages-1358550908.jpg 600w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=770,format=auto/https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/10200550/GettyImages-1358550908.jpg 770w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1000,format=auto/https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/10200550/GettyImages-1358550908.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1248,format=auto/https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/10200550/GettyImages-1358550908.jpg 1248w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1920,format=auto/https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/10200550/GettyImages-1358550908.jpg 1920w" imagesizes="100vw"/><meta name="next-head-count" content="39"/><script data-dismissed-view-state="Closed" data-lazy-load-ui="on" src="https://cdn.transcend.io/cm/ee571c7f-030a-41b2-affa-70df8a47b57b/airgap.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">;window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.init={distributed_tracing:{enabled:true},privacy:{cookies_enabled:true},ajax:{deny_list:["bam-cell.nr-data.net"]}};

class="sc-88397d11-6 bAUply article-content-container bodytext1"><p>The time on the clock was creeping into the wee morning hours where he was in Belgium, but after what Ike Ugbo had just witnessed on TV, he couldn’t sit still.</p><p>At BMO Field in Toronto, the Canada men’s team had just come back to beat Panama 4-1 on the sixth matchday of CONCACAF <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/world-cup/">World Cup</a> qualifying with an entertaining, full-throttle approach. Qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1986 began to look like a possibility.</p><div class="ad-container"><div class="ad-wrapper article-treatment"><div class=ad-slug-container><p class="ad-slug">Advertisement</p></div><div id="mid1" data-position="mid1" class="ad place-ad"></div></div></div><p>With the sun starting to appear, Ugbo, 24, decided he wanted in on the experience. He fired off a text message to Canada centre-back Doneil Henry – five years Ugbo’s senior, but a familiar face because the two had grown up five minutes apart in Brampton, Ontario.</p><p>“He was megging me when I was in grade five, and we used to beat him up,” said Henry, with a smile.</p><p>Ugbo asked Henry how he could get involved in the <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/team/canada/">Canada</a> team. A talented product of the Chelsea academy, Ugbo had bounced around on loan deals, leading to questions about his long-term potential. Henry posed a question of his own in response to Ugbo’s text: Do you have the right mentality to play on this team?</p><p>Ugbo insisted he did, so Henry passed the message over to Canada head coach John Herdman.</p><p>Herdman had inquired about Ugbo’s availability to play for Canada early in his tenure as head coach, but was told by Chelsea staff that Ugbo was only interested in representing <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/team/england/">England</a> after playing for several of their youth national teams. Still, Ugbo remained eligible to play for Canada. And as a vital forward in an attack-minded Canada squad, the World Cup could finally be the time for the AC Troyes man, long considered an outsider in Chelsea’s ranks and whose career has taken winding turns, to deliver on years of promise, and carve out a place for himself.</p><hr><p>When Ugbo closed his eyes and thought about being four years old and playing soccer in Brampton, two images came to mind.</p><p>“Scoring a lot of goals,” he said with a smile. “And, our jerseys were sponsored by Tim Hortons.”</p><p>Born in London, Ugbo moved to Canada with his mother and sisters while still in preschool. His father remained in the UK to work, but traveled between the two countries often. When his father was with him, he would regale his son with stories of the Nigeria team at the 1994 World Cup, who topped their group.</p><div class="ad-container"><div class="ad-wrapper article-treatment"><div class=ad-slug-container><p class="ad-slug">Advertisement</p></div><div id="mid2" data-position="mid2" class="ad place-ad"></div></div></div><p>As fate would have it, his family had moved to what would eventually become the soccer capital of Canada, home to some of the country’s best players,&nbsp; including <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/atiba-hutchinson-N1Ckc4iGCHPSN16t/">Atiba Hutchinson</a>, <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/tajon-buchanan-eMpTEnfBcI5W1N3h/">Tajon Buchanan</a>, <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/jonathan-osorio-XSFblj5N4MrDHOlF/">Jonathan Osorio</a> and, of course, Henry.</p><p>“When I look back, I can see how much growth Canada has had, and how far Canada has come to where we are today,” said Ugbo.</p><p>Eventually, the distance between the family became too great and Ugbo, then nine, and his family returned to England. Ugbo began playing recreationally there, but readily admits that, having grown up in Canada, he failed to understand just how deeply entrenched soccer is in England’s national psyche.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="https://theathletic.com/3760014/2022/11/15/canada-world-cup-squad-guide/">Canada World Cup 2022 squad guide: A Geordie coach, the Iceman, and a players’ strike</a></strong></em></p><p>After a few months playing as a midfielder in a friendly Sunday league, Ugbo was approached by a Chelsea scout offering a chance to train at their academy.</p><p>“At the time, I didn’t see it as big as it was,” he said.</p><p>He was playing as a No. 10, but after changes in the squad forced him to move to striker as a 16-year-old, he was able to stay in the position because of his natural instincts for finishing.</p><p>“You learn different types of movements needed,” said Ugbo. “When I made the transition, I brought things that I had to use while playing in midfield. It just clicks well.”</p><p>For the majority of his time in the Chelsea academy, highlighted by UEFA Youth League titles in 2015 and 2016, things clicked for him. He signed his first professional contract with Chelsea in 2015.</p><p>But almost immediately, his eyes became bigger than his stomach. As a 17-year-old he thought, <i>I have to play first team football as soon as possible.</i></p><p>“I was ready to learn everything from a young age, including the difficulties,” he said.</p><p>Joining a Chelsea first team with <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/premier-league/">Premier League</a> and <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/champions-league/">Champions League</a> title aspirations wasn’t possible. His father wanted him to get outside of his comfort zone and go abroad. Instead, Ugbo went on loan with Barnsley in the EFL Championship. Regular playing time and goals did not come. The same was the case for his loan to League One side MK Dons for the second half of the 2017-18 season, as well as his loan to another League One side, Scunthorpe United, for 2018-19.</p><div class="ad-container"><div class="ad-wrapper article-treatment"><div class=ad-slug-container><p class="ad-slug">Advertisement</p></div><div id="mid3" data-position="mid3" class="ad place-ad"></div></div></div><p>He had rushed into his professional career, scoring just five goals across those three teams in his two seasons on loan.</p><p>“It looked like maybe I wasn’t ready, and you could say that,” Ugbo said. “I was still a kid. I had to learn fast.”</p><p>This shock was coupled with living away from home for the first time, and the new responsibilities he had to learn — be it maintaining a clean apartment or eating healthy. He struggled with the latter, to the point that it negatively impacted his performances.</p><p>“Your body is asking for more than in Under-23’s football because the intensity is even higher,” he said. “It was a real shock to me at the time.”</p><p>During his scoring drought and frequent moves, he wondered whether he’d succeed as a professional soccer player.</p><p>“Sometimes there were doubts through the first two loans, for sure,” he said. “Like, ‘Where’s my level?’”</p><p>Conversations with those closest to him all eventually came to the same conclusion: the teams he was trying to crack would not change their approach to fit Ugbo. Instead, he needed to better understand his surroundings.</p><p>“You have to be quicker at adapting to the team’s tactics,” he said of what he learned through his first few failed loan spells. “I don’t think many coaches will change the tactics for you.”</p><p>He employed that mentality when he finally did get out of his comfort zone with a loan to JC Roda in the Dutch second division. His 13 goals in 28 league matches bolstered his confidence through the 2019-20 season, as did the 16 goals he scored in 32 matches on loan in Belgium’s top flight with Cercle Brugge. He now had the belief instilled in him from Cercle Brugge head coach (and former Chelsea assistant) Paul Clement of his potential as a scorer in a European top flight. Ugbo found himself asking more questions of Clement than he ever had of any previous manager to better understand how he could be effective.</p><div class="ad-container"><div class="ad-wrapper article-treatment"><div class=ad-slug-container><p class="ad-slug">Advertisement</p></div><div id="mid4" data-position="mid4" class="ad place-ad"></div></div></div><p>The conclusion of the 2020-21 season brought the end of Ugbo’s Chelsea contract. But for the first time in his career he had the confidence and agency over his career that he never did while bouncing from loan move to loan move. Ugbo had finally learned what qualities made him his most dangerous on the pitch.</p><p>“A nuisance,” he said. “Being everywhere and being clinical. Not needing many chances, just one or two, to score. That’s when I’m at best.”</p><hr><p>Ugbo’s goal-scoring put him on the radar of multiple national teams. In September 2021, as Ugbo was beginning to find the back of the net with Genk on a new permanent deal in the Belgian first division, he publicly stated that he would represent Nigeria. The chance to play in the 2022 World Cup was a driving factor.</p><p>Quietly, Ugbo still hesitated with his decision. He says now that he never heard from then-Nigeria national team coach Gernot Rohr throughout the process.</p><p>“And,” he added, “I never grew up in Nigeria, either.”</p><p>His first conversation with Herdman in October 2021 changed everything.</p><p>“(Herdman) knew about me from when I was at Chelsea,” Ugbo said. “He knew exactly what I was going through. He spoke to me about the ambitions of Canada and what he’s trying to do and what he’d already done. Already I could see, without him telling me, the direction Canada was going in.”</p><p>The Canada national team’s upward trajectory matched his own. He committed to Canada just before they departed for Edmonton and earned two crucial wins in November 2021 against <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/team/costa-rica/">Costa Rica</a> and <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/team/mexico/">Mexico</a> to go to the top of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying table.</p><p>“He adapted well, right when he came on the team,” said fellow Canada forward <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/lucas-cavallini-JkPvRlZmuGbyeVqX/">Lucas Cavallini</a>.</p><p>This includes connecting with teammates about fashion, which he sees as an outlet to express his personality. During the team’s June camp in Vancouver, Henry took Ugbo to some of his favourite clothing spots on Robson Street. Henry’s guidance helped turn Ugbo on to new designers.</p><div class="ad-container"><div class="ad-wrapper article-treatment"><div class=ad-slug-container><p class="ad-slug">Advertisement</p></div><div id="mid5" data-position="mid5" class="ad place-ad"></div></div></div><p>But even Henry, who takes more fashion risks than his teammates, was taken aback.</p><p>“Some of the things that he would wear, I would never wear,” Henry said, cracking a quick smile. “It’s just offside for me.”</p><p>During the June camp, Ugbo gained enough confidence to start imparting some of his own personality on other teammates – for example, having noticed that Cavallini’s Spotify playlists relied too heavily on reggaeton, Ugbo grabbed Cavallini’s phone and added more American hip-hop to the mix in this past June’s international window.</p><p>“He introduced me to some artists that I never used to listen to,” said Cavallini, “but now he’s got me hooked on them.”</p><p>Ugbo is also making an impression on the pitch. He can use his instincts to quickly get inside of defenders before using his strength to maintain that positioning. Crucially, he can be a clinical finisher close to goal.</p><p>“(Ugbo) always finds himself in the right situations,” said Canada teammate <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/jonathan-david-Et4NAVPdTF6ydvmB/">Jonathan David</a>. “When his back is against the goal, he’s very good at holding the ball up, twisting, turning in and finding his way out.”</p><p>But in a World Cup year, Ugbo’s potential is hardly as important as his current output. It took longer than Ugbo wanted to sign a permanent deal with Troyes ahead of this season, which cut into his pre-season and training camp. He looked sluggish, playing with a heavy touch early in the season. Ugbo only began to move more fluidly and find more scoring opportunities in September.</p><p>Ugbo’s next step will be taking on more of a prominent role in the Canada team and extinguishing that outsider tag once and for all.</p><p>“I think that can only be established through performance,” Herdman told <i>The Athletic</i>. “(He) would probably walk into another position on the field, but in that forward line with Jonathan David, <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/alphonso-davies-qnqRAuVJiQpPXNMU/">Alphonso Davies</a>, <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/cyle-larin-yjmnG87vvfRt19Q0/">Cyle Larin</a>, <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/junior-hoilett-AkwP7mklCHEUVnyr/">Junior Hoilett</a> and Tajon Buchanan, that’s a tough group to break. So with Ike, it’s about a massive season for Troyes.”</p><p>Still, there is a potential window of opportunity for Ugbo to make a mark. Cavallini occupies a similar No. 9 role as Ugbo, but with his Vancouver Whitecaps falling short of the <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/mls/">MLS</a> playoffs, Cavallini didn’t get regular playing time heading into the World Cup. Larin is Canada’s all-time leading scorer, but regular minutes at Club Brugge have been few and far between.</p><p>Then there is the matter of tactical flexibility, something Herdman demanded of the 10 forwards he invited to Canada’s September camp. Could Ugbo adapt to a new role, as opposed to a typical goal-front poacher for Canada? Will that be the final step to him earning a start at the World Cup?</p><p>Ugbo sincerely hopes so.</p><p>“The performances in your club team, especially for me, it’s just about goals and assists, making sure I’m performing on a regular basis, no matter the team,” said Ugbo.</p><p>He spoke in a more serious tone, before his child-like smile appeared again.</p><p>After bouncing around for most of his career, ahead of the World Cup, he’s finally found where he can have the most important impact of his career to date.</p><p>“I feel this (Canada’s national team) is where I belong.”</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong></em><a href="https://theathletic.com/3929065/2022/11/23/belgium-vs-canada-result/"><em><strong>Belgium vs Canada result: Batshuayi strikes on the break after Davies misses penalty</strong></em></a></p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>(Photo: Perry vd Leuvert/BSR Agency/Getty Images)</em></p>

time on the clock was creeping into the wee morning hours where he was in Belgium, but after what Ike Ugbo had just witnessed on TV, he couldn’t sit still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt BMO Field in Toronto, the Canada men’s team had just come back to beat Panama 4-1 on the sixth matchday of CONCACAF \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/world-cup/'\u003eWorld Cup\u003c/a\u003e qualifying with an entertaining, full-throttle approach. Qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1986 began to look like a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the sun starting to appear, Ugbo, 24, decided he wanted in on the experience. He fired off a text message to Canada centre-back Doneil Henry – five years Ugbo’s senior, but a familiar face because the two had grown up five minutes apart in Brampton, Ontario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was megging me when I was in grade five, and we used to beat him up,” said Henry, with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgbo asked Henry how he could get involved in the \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/team/canada/'\u003eCanada\u003c/a\u003e team. A talented product of the Chelsea academy, Ugbo had bounced around on loan deals, leading to questions about his long-term potential. Henry posed a question of his own in response to Ugbo’s text: Do you have the right mentality to play on this team?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgbo insisted he did, so Henry passed the message over to Canada head coach John Herdman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerdman had inquired about Ugbo’s availability to play for Canada early in his tenure as head coach, but was told by Chelsea staff that Ugbo was only interested in representing \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/team/england/'\u003eEngland\u003c/a\u003e after playing for several of their youth national teams. Still, Ugbo remained eligible to play for Canada. And as a vital forward in an attack-minded Canada squad, the World Cup could finally be the time for the AC Troyes man, long considered an outsider in Chelsea’s ranks and whose career has taken winding turns, to deliver on years of promise, and carve out a place for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ugbo closed his eyes and thought about being four years old and playing soccer in Brampton, two images came to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scoring a lot of goals,” he said with a smile. “And, our jerseys were sponsored by Tim Hortons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorn in London, Ugbo moved to Canada with his mother and sisters while still in preschool. His father remained in the UK to work, but traveled between the two countries often. When his father was with him, he would regale his son with stories of the Nigeria team at the 1994 World Cup, who topped their group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs fate would have it, his family had moved to what would eventually become the soccer capital of Canada, home to some of the country’s best players,  including \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/player/atiba-hutchinson-N1Ckc4iGCHPSN16t/'\u003eAtiba Hutchinson\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/player/tajon-buchanan-eMpTEnfBcI5W1N3h/'\u003eTajon Buchanan\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/player/jonathan-osorio-XSFblj5N4MrDHOlF/'\u003eJonathan Osorio\u003c/a\u003e and, of course, Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I look back, I can see how much growth Canada has had, and how far Canada has come to where we are today,” said Ugbo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, the distance between the family became too great and Ugbo, then nine, and his family returned to England. Ugbo began playing recreationally there, but readily admits that, having grown up in Canada, he failed to understand just how deeply entrenched soccer is in England’s national psyche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRead more: \u003ca href=\"https://theathletic.com/3760014/2022/11/15/canada-world-cup-squad-guide/\"\u003eCanada World Cup 2022 squad guide: A Geordie coach, the Iceman, and a players\u0026#8217; strike\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few months playing as a midfielder in a friendly Sunday league, Ugbo was approached by a Chelsea scout offering a chance to train at their academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the time, I didn’t see it as big as it was,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was playing as a No. 10, but after changes in the squad forced him to move to striker as a 16-year-old, he was able to stay in the position because of his natural instincts for finishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You learn different types of movements needed,” said Ugbo. “When I made the transition, I brought things that I had to use while playing in midfield. It just clicks well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the majority of his time in the Chelsea academy, highlighted by UEFA Youth League titles in 2015 and 2016, things clicked for him. He signed his first professional contract with Chelsea in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut almost immediately, his eyes became bigger than his stomach. As a 17-year-old he thought, \u003ci\u003eI have to play first team football as soon as possible.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was ready to learn everything from a young age, including the difficulties,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoining a Chelsea first team with \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/premier-league/'\u003ePremier League\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/champions-league/'\u003eChampions League\u003c/a\u003e title aspirations wasn\u0026#8217;t possible. His father wanted him to get outside of his comfort zone and go abroad. Instead, Ugbo went on loan with Barnsley in the EFL Championship. Regular playing time and goals did not come. The same was the case for his loan to League One side MK Dons for the second half of the 2017-18 season, as well as his loan to another League One side, Scunthorpe United, for 2018-19.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had rushed into his professional career, scoring just five goals across those three teams in his two seasons on loan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looked like maybe I wasn’t ready, and you could say that,” Ugbo said. “I was still a kid. I had to learn fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis shock was coupled with living away from home for the first time, and the new responsibilities he had to learn — be it maintaining a clean apartment or eating healthy. He struggled with the latter, to the point that it negatively impacted his performances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your body is asking for more than in Under-23’s football because the intensity is even higher,” he said. “It was a real shock to me at the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his scoring drought and frequent moves, he wondered whether he’d succeed as a professional soccer player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes there were doubts through the first two loans, for sure,” he said. “Like, ‘Where\u0026#8217;s my level?’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversations with those closest to him all eventually came to the same conclusion: the teams he was trying to crack would not change their approach to fit Ugbo. Instead, he needed to better understand his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to be quicker at adapting to the team’s tactics,” he said of what he learned through his first few failed loan spells. “I don’t think many coaches will change the tactics for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe employed that mentality when he finally did get out of his comfort zone with a loan to JC Roda in the Dutch second division. His 13 goals in 28 league matches bolstered his confidence through the 2019-20 season, as did the 16 goals he scored in 32 matches on loan in Belgium’s top flight with Cercle Brugge. He now had the belief instilled in him from Cercle Brugge head coach (and former Chelsea assistant) Paul Clement of his potential as a scorer in a European top flight. Ugbo found himself asking more questions of Clement than he ever had of any previous manager to better understand how he could be effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conclusion of the 2020-21 season brought the end of Ugbo\u0026#8217;s Chelsea contract. But for the first time in his career he had the confidence and agency over his career that he never did while bouncing from loan move to loan move. Ugbo had finally learned what qualities made him his most dangerous on the pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A nuisance,” he said. “Being everywhere and being clinical. Not needing many chances, just one or two, to score. That’s when I’m at best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgbo’s goal-scoring put him on the radar of multiple national teams. In September 2021, as Ugbo was beginning to find the back of the net with Genk on a new permanent deal in the Belgian first division, he publicly stated that he would represent Nigeria. The chance to play in the 2022 World Cup was a driving factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuietly, Ugbo still hesitated with his decision. He says now that he never heard from then-Nigeria national team coach Gernot Rohr throughout the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And,” he added, “I never grew up in Nigeria, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first conversation with Herdman in October 2021 changed everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“(Herdman) knew about me from when I was at Chelsea,” Ugbo said. “He knew exactly what I was going through. He spoke to me about the ambitions of Canada and what he’s trying to do and what he’d already done. Already I could see, without him telling me, the direction Canada was going in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Canada national team’s upward trajectory matched his own. He committed to Canada just before they departed for Edmonton and earned two crucial wins in November 2021 against \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/team/costa-rica/'\u003eCosta Rica\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/team/mexico/'\u003eMexico\u003c/a\u003e to go to the top of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He adapted well, right when he came on the team,” said fellow Canada forward \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/player/lucas-cavallini-JkPvRlZmuGbyeVqX/'\u003eLucas Cavallini\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis includes connecting with teammates about fashion, which he sees as an outlet to express his personality. During the team’s June camp in Vancouver, Henry took Ugbo to some of his favourite clothing spots on Robson Street. Henry’s guidance helped turn Ugbo on to new designers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even Henry, who takes more fashion risks than his teammates, was taken aback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some of the things that he would wear, I would never wear,” Henry said, cracking a quick smile. “It’s just offside for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the June camp, Ugbo gained enough confidence to start imparting some of his own personality on other teammates – for example, having noticed that Cavallini’s Spotify playlists relied too heavily on reggaeton, Ugbo grabbed Cavallini’s phone and added more American hip-hop to the mix in this past June’s international window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He introduced me to some artists that I never used to listen to,” said Cavallini, “but now he’s got me hooked on them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgbo is also making an impression on the pitch. He can use his instincts to quickly get inside of defenders before using his strength to maintain that positioning. Crucially, he can be a clinical finisher close to goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“(Ugbo) always finds himself in the right situations,” said Canada teammate \u003ca class='ath_autolink' href='https://theathletic.com/football/player/jonathan-david-Et4NAVPdTF6ydvmB/'\u003eJonathan David\u003c/a\u003e. “When his back is against the goal, he\u0026#8217;s very good at holding the ball up, twisting, turning in and finding his way out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in a World Cup year, Ugbo’s potential is hardly as important as his current output.

Ugbo had finally learned what qualities made him his most dangerous on the pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“A nuisance,” he said. “Being everywhere and being clinical.

In September 2021, as Ugbo was beginning to find the back of the net with Genk on a new permanent deal in the Belgian first division, he publicly stated that he would represent Nigeria. The chance to play in the 2022 World Cup was a driving factor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuietly, Ugbo still hesitated with his decision. He says now that he never heard from then-Nigeria national team coach Gernot Rohr throughout the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“And,” he added, “I never grew up in Nigeria, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis first conversation with Herdman in October 2021 changed everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“(Herdman) knew about me from when I was at Chelsea,” Ugbo said. “He knew exactly what I was going through.

He can use his instincts to quickly get inside of defenders before using his strength to maintain that positioning.

It took longer than Ugbo wanted to sign a permanent deal with Troyes ahead of this season, which cut into his pre-season and training camp. He looked sluggish, playing with a heavy touch early in the season. Ugbo only began to move more fluidly and find more scoring opportunities in September.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUgbo’s next step will be taking on more of a prominent role in the Canada team and extinguishing that outsider tag once and for all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think that can only be established through performance,” Herdman told \u003ci\u003eThe Athletic\u003c/i\u003e. “(He) would probably walk into another position on the field, but in that forward line with Jonathan David, \u003ca class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/football/player/alphonso-davies-qnqRAuVJiQpPXNMU/\"\u003eAlphonso Davies\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/football/player/cyle-larin-yjmnG87vvfRt19Q0/\"\u003eCyle Larin\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/football/player/junior-hoilett-AkwP7mklCHEUVnyr/\"\u003eJunior Hoilett\u003c/a\u003e and Tajon Buchanan, that’s a tough group to break.

Cavallini occupies a similar No. 9 role as Ugbo, but with his Vancouver Whitecaps falling short of the \u003ca class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/football/mls/\"\u003eMLS\u003c/a\u003e playoffs, Cavallini didn’t get regular playing time heading into the World Cup. Larin is Canada’s all-time leading scorer, but regular minutes at Club Brugge have been few and far between.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there is the matter of tactical flexibility, something Herdman demanded of the 10 forwards he invited to Canada’s September camp.
