Martin O’Neill says he felt he was treated as an “outsider” as Ireland
manager

Some fascinating comments from the former Ireland boss.

   Martin O’Neill has said that he feels as though he was treated as an
   “outsider” while he was Ireland manager.

   O’Neill managed Ireland from 2013 until 2018, helping qualify the team
   for Euro 2016, and guiding them to the round-of-16 at that tournament.

   However, despite the incredible highs of Euro ’16, there were some
   undeniable lows too, and O’Neill ultimately left his job as a divisive
   figure among Irish football fans.

   Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, O’Neill said that by the end of his
   time in charge, he was viewed in a similar light to Giovanni
   Trapattoni, in that he was seen as an outsider.

   He said that once he realised that, it didn’t matter that results were
   “okay”, and that it would be difficult to win back the fanbase.

   He said: “The truth is this: there were a number of times that I was
   called ‘the Northerner’ or ‘the outsider’ and I was treated in many
   ways the same way as Trapattoni eventually became: one of those figures
   you tend to hate. I think that was it.

   “My persona didn’t seem to fit with them throughout the time,” he
   added, “and I’m even going back to heavy criticism in the early stages
   of our 2016 European campaign when we were in the same group as
   Germany, Poland, Scotland and Georgia.

   “When we only drew with Scotland in Dublin and we still had plenty of
   matches to go, the criticism was very heavy at that stage but we made
   it through.

   “I think if you are viewed as a bit of an outsider to begin with then
   it’s hard, regardless of results being okay, to win them back again.
   That would be my thoughts on it.”

   O’Neill has made his opinions on new Ireland manager Stephen Kenny very
   clear with some of the comments he has made in recent months. More on
   that here.
