   Art Term

Outsider art

   Outsider art is used to describe art that has a naïve quality, often
   produced by people who have not trained as artists or worked within the
   conventional structures of art production
--
   The art of children, psychiatric patients and prisoners who create art
   outwith the conventional structures of art training and art production
   is often categorised as outsider art. In 1964 the French artist Jean
   Dubuffet started to collect artworks he considered to be free from
   societal constraints. This was termed art brut (raw art) – another term
   for outsider art – and in 1948 he founded the Compagnie de L’Art Brut
   with André Breton.
