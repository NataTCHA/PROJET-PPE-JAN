Can this ‘art world outsider’ draw in an art-curious YouTube crowd?

Hosted by a science writer and actor, the Getty’s "Becoming Artsy" video
series ditches the traditional documentary delivery of art history in favour
of emotion, drama and fun

   “Hi, I’m Jessie. I’m a sciencey math kind of person, and yet, I work at
   the Getty—famous for its art and culture.” So begins each ten-minute
   episode of the J. Paul Getty Trust’s light-hearted YouTube video series
   Becoming Artsy.

   The initiative was launched a year ago as an introduction to the Los
   Angeles-based organisation’s museum, research institute and gardens. In
   its newly released second series, it has morphed into a programme that
   promotes learning about art through the lenses of science and history,
   with recent episodes including topics such as jousting and human
   anatomy.

   The goal is to make the Getty (and the art world in general) less
   intimidating for people who do not know much about art but are curious
   to learn. As a science writer and actor with little knowledge of art
   history, Jessie Hendricks, the series host, is “becoming artsy” along
   with her audience.

   The series is the brainchild of Christopher Sprinkle, the lead creative
   producer at the Getty, who had grown increasingly frustrated with
   making YouTube explainers alongside the Getty’s curators and staff.
   While being extremely knowledgeable, his expert interviewees were often
   not comfortable in front of the camera. “It was like pulling teeth
   trying to get emotion and drama out of them,” Sprinkle says.

   That is how he got the idea of hiring a host who could “lighten the air
   and ask questions in a way that people without a background in art
   history could relate to”. Hendricks says: “They wanted a host not
   afraid to ask the simple questions, like, who’s Ed Ruscha? I did ask
   that question.”

   Hands on: some of the highlights from season two of Becoming Artsy
   include (clockwise from top left) making ultramarine blue from lapis
   lazuli, zooming in on medieval calligraphy, the shieldwork physics of
   jousting, and working out what the past actually looked like Courtesy

   Hendricks is not only the host of the series but also the writer,
   producer and—most of the time—cameraperson. (She calls herself a
   “one-man-band content creator”.) She and Sprinkle work together on the
   series, but after the first couple of introductory episodes, he gave
   her free rein to explore any topic she wanted, wrangling curators and
   asking fellow staff members for suggestions in the process. “I’ve been
   fortunate to craft the episodes to my interests and follow my
   instincts,” she says. Both she and Sprinkle are particularly
   enthusiastic about a recent episode in which she and Getty staff make
   ultramarine pigment from scratch, just as artists did during the
   Renaissance.

   Becoming Artsy is an unusual YouTube series for an art museum, and not
   just because it is hosted by an art outsider. While other museum videos
   focus on specific works in their collections and film using what
   Sprinkle calls a “traditional documentary style”, the Getty’s series is
   more hands-on. In an episode on jousting, for instance, Hendricks and
   Larisa Grollemond, a curator in the manuscripts department, drive more
   than an hour north of LA to take a jousting class together while
   discussing the history of the sport and its depiction in Medieval
   manuscripts.

   When asked which videos inspired the feel of Becoming Artsy, Hendricks
   and Sprinkle cite history and science series more than those about art.
   Hendricks is a fan of Physics Girl, Raven the Science Maven, and The
   Brain Scoop from the Field Museum in Chicago. They both mention the
   explainers from the US media company Vox as some of their favourite
   videos.

   Sprinkle says in his original pitch for Becoming Artsy, he used the
   example of a 2017 video on Stonehenge by Vox producer Joss Fong, in
   which she explains the history and significance of the prehistoric
   monument while making a scale model of it on her living room floor. He
   liked how “anti-stock footage” and “conversational” it felt. In the
   first episode of Becoming Artsy, Hendricks sits on the floor of her
   porch and tiles a surface while talking about the Getty Villa.

   It is clear from the videos that the Getty staff are having a great
   time and, although some moments come off as twee, it is all part of the
   appeal. “We want to counter the impression that the Getty is an elitist
   organisation,” says Sprinkle. “I want us to make content that both my
   mum and my daughter would want to watch.”

   Casting a wide net is the reason behind hosting a video series on
   YouTube in the first place. “It’s the largest searched site on the
   internet after Google, and an incredible way to reach audiences around
   the world,” Sprinkle points out.

   According to Hendricks, Becoming Artsy has been viewed in more than 50
   countries, with the two main audiences being the US and the UK. The
   first episode, released on 5 October 2021, currently has the most views
   —almost 10,000. One titled A Beginner’s Guide to Appreciating Art comes
   in second with more than 7,000 views. “The priority is to attract new
   audiences, those who might be art-curious,” Hendricks says. And not
   just to the Getty, but to any art museum in the world.
